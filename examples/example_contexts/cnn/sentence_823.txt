A gene that affects the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate - as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. US researchers discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. Plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change-resistant cocoa plants, which could boost plants’ yields and the income of farmers. A gene involved in determining the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, scientists claim.  A stock image of chocolates is shown. More than five million cocoa farmers and their families depend on cocoa for their livelihoods around the world, where Cacao, Theobroma cacao L is cultivated in West Africa, Central and South America. The World Cocoa Foundation puts annual cocoa production worldwide at 3.8 million tons, which is valued at $11.8 billion (£7.9 billion). Each cocoa pod has 40 seeds, which are composed of cocoa butter and used in the making of chocolate – and some drugs. Lead researcher Mark Guiltinan, professor of plant molecular biology at Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences said that cocoa butter with altered melting points may find new uses in specialty chocolates, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
