The earthquake disaster in Nepal has highlighted how Earth's land masses are already in the process of forming a new supercontinent. That's according to one researcher who travelled to the country to study how the Indian and Eurasian plates are moving together. And using new techniques, researchers can now start examining the changes due to take place over the next tens of millions of years like never before. Earth's continents are slowly moving together (left), and in 50 to 200 million years they are expected to form a new supercontinent called Amasia (right). In 2012 a study suggested this may be centered on the North Pole. Recent evidence is revealing how this will compare to the ancient supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea. The idea that Earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed Amasia - is not new. But, as reported by Peter Spinks from the Sydney Morning Herald, Curtin University geologist Dr Zheng-Xiang Li travelled to Nepal to study the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The idea that Earth is set to form a new supercontinent - dubbed Amasia - is not new. But new techniques are allowing experts to study the changes in unprececdented ways. Where exactly this supercontinent will form, however, has been the cause of some debate. While some had suspected it would be centered around Africa, a study by Yale University in 2012 suggested that the North Pole would actually be the centre point. North and South America will
