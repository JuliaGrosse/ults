Kelly Ripa has been grief stricken following the sad news that her friend, cosmetic surgeon Dr Fredric Brandt, was found dead by suicide at his Miami mansion on Sunday. So it's understandable that 44-year-old TV star was looking morose as she left her New York City apartment on Tuesday. The Live With Kelly & Michael co-host, who is usually seen smiling, wore a frown as she left the building alone. When appearing on her morning show she said, 'He was such a great man... he was just a great person, a great friend, he will be missed - I cannot tell you how much I will miss him. I will miss him every day of my life.' Sad day: Kelly Ripa looked to be in mourning on Tuesday as she left her NYC apartment; on Sunday it was announced her surgeon friend Dr Fredric Brandt had died. The personality added, 'If you love someone tell them every day that you love them because you don't know if you will have that opportunity.... It's sad. Oh my gosh, he was just the best. He would sing to you while he put Botox in your face - any song you wanted. He could sing anything at a moment's notice.' The former soap opera actress was dressed casually in a yellow sweater and worn-in jeans. Comfortable short beige boots and aviators completed her look. It seemed as if Ripa had wet hair and hardly any makeup on.
