Denmark's Crown Princess Mary might have wowed in a succession of evening gowns last week but Sunday was all about low-key family time for the Australian-born royal. Mary, 43, treated her three youngest children, Princess Isabella, seven, and twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent, four, to a day out at a farm in Kirke Hyllinge, a village in Zealand. Making the most of the sunny weather, the quartet certainly appeared to be having fun, with all four crouching down to pet a tiny Holstein Friesian calf. Scroll down for video. Enjoying the sunshine: Denmark's Crown Princess Mary and her daughters Isabella and Josephine. Despite the potential for getting dirty, Mary was as fashionable as ever and appeared to have taken inspiration from the rural location in her tweed jacket and jeans. The three children, meanwhile, were well-wrapped up in cosy padded jackets and appeared fascinated by the cows grazing in one of the barns, with Prince Vincent even climbing a fence to get a better look. But not everyone fancied a day out at the farm, with Mary left without her husband Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and eldest son Prince Christian, nine, for the outing. The visit, which was part of Denmark's annual Eco Day celebrations, came days after royals from around Europe descended on Copenhagen for Queen Margrethe II's 75th birthday celebrations.
