Manchester United duo Marcos Rojo and Angel di Maria celebrated their 3-1 triumph over Aston Villa by flying out to Lisbon on Easter Sunday. United defender Rojo uploaded an image of himself posing alongside fellow Argentina international Di Maria and their families while sitting on a private plane. Rojo, who sat next to his wife and daughter, played the full 90 minutes against Villa while Premier League record signing Di Maria came on for the last 20.

The Manchester United and Argentina duo sealed moves to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window. Portugal is a familiar destination for both Rojo and Di Maria as they played for Sporting Lisbon and Benfica respectively before eventually joining United in the summer. Rojo made headlines for the wrong reasons on Saturday evening as the Mail On Sunday exclusively revealed he had an affair with fitness instructor Sarah Watson. She claimed Rojo had offered money to spend the night with him before eventually sleeping with the 25-year-old without knowing he was married with a young daughter. The Â£200,000-a-week Manchester United defender is said to have bombarded her with explicit messages and naked photos. Sarah Watson was determined to clear her name following blackmail allegations.
