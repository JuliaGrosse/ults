Wealth: Training consultant Jay Rutland, 34, with his 30-year-old billionaire wife Tamara Ecclestone. The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just £65 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just £3,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant’s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing ‘management consultancy activities’. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of £3,378, down from £18,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a £45million house in west London - married the heiress in a £7million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia’s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated £70,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas
