Football in Turkey has been suspended for one week following the armed attack on Fenerbahce's team bus on Saturday. Meanwhile, a Turkish official says police have detained two people suspected of involvement in the attack. Trabzon Governor Abdil Celil Oz said the two suspects were detained early on Tuesday and that one of them is believed to have followed the convoy while the other fired shots with a rifle at the bus. The decision to suspend football in Turkey affects both next weekend's Super Lig fixtures and the midweek cup quarter-finals, although Besiktas' match against Istanbul Basaksehir, the last of this weekend's Super Lig matches, is scheduled to go ahead on Monday evening. Fenerbahce's bus came under armed attack as it drove to the airport following an away match at Caykur Rizespor, which Fener won 5-1, in Turkey's Super Lig. Five round marks can be seen on the windscreen of the Fenerbahce team bus after the attack. The window nearest the driver was smashed during the attack on Saturday night. The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attack. Fenerbahce on Sunday demanded that football be suspended until the incident was dealt with and the perpetrators punished, and on Monday a one-week suspension was announced by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) following a meeting with sports minister Akif Cagatay Kilic.
