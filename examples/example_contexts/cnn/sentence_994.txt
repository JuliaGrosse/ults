A New Zealand couple needed a home upon returning home after living in the UK, so they built one on the back of an old flatbed truck. Hannah and Alex purchased a 1986 Hino flatbed and undertook their year and a half labor of love. The result was a solar-powered two-bedroom, wood and steel home that now allows them to live almost self-sufficiently in Nelson, New Zealand. How a truck becomes a home: A New Zealand couple built this country home on the bed of a flatbed truck. Making do: Alex (left) and Hannah (right) wanted a home that was cozy and all their own, but couldn't afford to buy a full-sized lot. 'We came back to New Zealand from the UK in 2009,' Alex told Smoking Tire. 'We knew we couldn't afford to buy property at that point. We didn't have money.' So, the couple started building. After a year and a half of taking the project one step at a time, the project took shape. Though, to hear Hannah tell it, they just slapped up the place in a weekend. '[We] welded a frame, put the wood on and built this house,' the modest Kiwi told Smoking Tire'sÂ Matt Farah. Once they finished, the couple drove their truck home out to a lot they'd purchased in Nelson, New Zealand. Now the couple and their cat live surrounded by nature: aromatic cypress wood inside the home and majestic trees
