Mohammed Emwazi, the British jihadi now known as Jihadi John, planned to join a different terror group in Somalia years before becoming a member of ISIS, it has been reported. Emwazi, who is originally from London, was planning on joining al-Shabaab in Africa but changed his mind after his friends were killed amid accusations they were set up by rival group members. Instead he travelled to Syria where he joined Islamic State and became synonymous with their gruesome beheading videos posted online. Scroll for video.

According to a 29-year-old Syrian, named only as Ayman, Emwazi was obsessed with al-Shabaab and constantly spoke about the fighting in Somalia. In an interview with The Independent, Ayman says Emwazi once confided in him that he planned to join al-Shabaab before coming to Syria because Somalia was too dangerous. Ayman, who said he met Emwazi in Syria after ISIS captured his hometown, added: 'Mohammed was obsessed with al-Shabaab, he was angry about what happened in Africa. 'Some of his friends had been killed, some sent to prison and he thought they had been betrayed.' Emwazi became convinced al-Shabaab had been infiltrated
