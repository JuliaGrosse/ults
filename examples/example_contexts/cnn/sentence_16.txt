STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE. This game is being billed as Beauty v the Beast, but don’t underestimate Arsene Wenger. It’s not just about style — he plays to win. The philosophy Wenger has imposed has made Arsenal popular throughout the world. People love to watch them, certainly more than Jose Mourinho’s teams. But on Sunday, he is up against the ultimate pragmatist — Mourinho finds any way to win. Chelsea have conceded just two goals in their last six clashes with Arsenal, keeping four clean sheets in the process. Mourinho does exactly what’s necessary. So while Wenger always aims to win, he still cares about the brand of football played. Mourinho’s brand is winning.

Wenger can not be underestimated, according to Martin Keown... it's not all about style, he plays to win. TALKING TACTICS. Arsenal should dominate possession while Chelsea are more likely to sit deep and use the electric pace of Eden Hazard and Willian on the break. Chelsea will be very disciplined and in some ways that is a shame because the players aren’t allowed to express themselves as they might. In the reverse fixture in October, Chelsea pressed Arsenal all over and Wenger’s side were stifled — they did not get a shot on target for the first time in a Premier League match since 2003.
