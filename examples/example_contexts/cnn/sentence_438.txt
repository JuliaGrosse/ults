The retired charity worker said: 'I've got a little Jack Russell and I took him out just after tea at 5pm. 'Suddenly there was a badger and two little'uns in my garden. 'He was the size of a pig, with teeth about six inches long. They were as long as a lemonade bottle is wide.' 'My dog turned me round and quickly pulled me in,' Mr Cooper added. 'The badger didn't attack me, so I didn't seek medical attention, but I was left badly shaken. 'If I hadn't have had my dog there, the badger could have had me.' Following the scare, the National Farmers' Union has issued advice for residents on protecting their property from invading badgers (stock photo)
