Rotherham have a serious fight on their hands to avoid relegation from the Championship after they were deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player. The Millers fielded Derby defender Farrend Rawson in their 1-0 win against Brighton on Easter Monday after his youth loan had expired. The Football League maintain the paperwork for his extension wasn’t handled properly. They have until May 1 to appeal the decision and, should they choose to, that could have ramifications with an ultimate decision likely to be taken after the season has finished. Rotherham manager Steve Evans has seen his side deducted three points by the Football League. On-loan Derby defender Farrend Rawson (third right) played in the 1-0 win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Rawson (right, pictured playing for Derby's Under 21 side) wore the Rotherham shirt four times. Rotherham were on 44 points (left) but are now just one point above the relegation zone after the deduction. A Football League statement read: 'Rotherham were also fined the sum of £30,000, half of which will be suspended until the end of the 2015-16 season. The club must also pay the costs of the hearing and the Football League.' The Football League set a precedent for penalties this time last year after slapping AFC Wimbledon with a three-point deduction and £5,000 fine after playing Jake Nicholson when he wasn’t registered correctly. Blackpool were fined £30,000
