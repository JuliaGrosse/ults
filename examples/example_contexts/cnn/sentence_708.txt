Oskar Groening (pictured earlier in the hearing) is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted. An Auschwitz survivor who lost 49 family members in the Holocaust says the fact that a 93-year-old former guard at the death camp is on trial is more important than any punishment. Eva Pusztai-Fahidi, who lost her parents and sister, told the Lueneburg state court today that seeing former SS officer Oskar Groening in court is 'a kind of satisfaction.' The 89-year-old says she could never have imagined she would be testifying before a German court and that 'for me it's not about the punishment', the DPA news agency reported. Her comments come after another Holocaust survivor angered her fellow plaintiffs by forgiving Groening - known as the 'bookkeeper of death' - and said he should not be prosecuted. Eva Mozes Kor, 81, who publicly embraced Groening in court last week in an extraordinary act of forgiveness, called for the trial to end. By doing so, she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in Germany. Groening is being tried on 300,000 counts of accessory to murder and faces a possible three to 15 years if convicted. Prosecutors argue his role sorting prisoners' stolen valuables, to which he admits, helped the death camp function. Mrs
