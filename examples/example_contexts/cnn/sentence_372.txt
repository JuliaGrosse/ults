Paul Armstrong, 26, of Sunderland, flew to Cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an IT project manager. But after a spending spree on the trip, Armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch, extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage. A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to'startle and repel'. Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it. Judge John Milford QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs. 'What he did was foolish. It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items. 'A stun gun is, within the legislation of this country, a firearm. It is an extremely serious offence to possess one. 'It is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country.' The 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with Â£2
