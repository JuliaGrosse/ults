Arizona's  only Hispanic governor, Raul Castro, has died at age 98. Castro passed away on Friday morning while in his sleep in San Diego where he was in hospice care, family spokesman James Garcia said. He was a self-made man, the embodiment of the American dream overcoming poverty and discrimination to graduate from college, and launch a successful career in politics and diplomacy. During his career, Castro also served as an American ambassador to three countries including El Salvador, Bolivia and Argentina. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said Castro 'lived a full life of exemplary service to Arizona and its people.' Raul Hector Castro (above pictured in 2006), former governor of Arizona died on Friday morning. 'He was an honorable public servant, a history-maker, a beloved family man and a strong friend and fighter for Arizona,' Ducey said in a statement. Castro is survived by his wife, Pat  and his two daughters, Mary Pat James and Beth Castro, according to AZ Central. Growing up on the US-Mexico border near Douglas, Arizona, Castro saw discrimination around him.

'America is the land of opportunity,' he told The Associated Press in 2010. 'Here, one can accomplish whatever they want to be. But you've got to work for it.' He said he wondered why the Hispanics were laborers and none delivered the mail
