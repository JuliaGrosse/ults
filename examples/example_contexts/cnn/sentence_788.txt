Eight years ago, after his AC Milan team had beaten Liverpool to win the Champions League final in Athens, Kaka knelt in the centre circle, spread his arms out wide, tilted his head back and turned his eyes to the skies in a gesture of worship and supplication. The Brazilian superstar was wearing a vest on which he had printed the proud statement 'I Belong to Jesus'. It was a striking, bold image of a man not afraid to display his faith. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I can't remember anybody screaming that what Kaka had done was a 'disgrace'. I can't remember him being mocked or ridiculed. I can't remember anyone saying his gesture was an affront to public decency. Kaka showed off an 'I belong to Jesus' vest after AC Milan's Champions League win against Liverpool in 2007. The Brazilian midfielder, who is deeply religious, was not mocked or ridiculed for the message on his clothes. I can't remember public anger being mobilised against him or him being held up as a symbol of a creeping, sinister malaise in our society. I can't remember Kaka being criticised for his faith. I can't remember anyone saying that such shows of religious devotion were out of place at a football match. Last Monday night, I went to an LA Dodgers game at Dodger Stadium. As always before a sporting event of any size in the States, professional or high school, the crowd sang the national anthem lustily.
