With superfans already eagerly camped out at St. Mary's Hospital ahead of Kate Middleton's due date, it seems that the birth of Prince George in 2013 did nothing to diminish the undeniable global fascination surrounding royal babies. And it's not just Brits that are starting to make excited estimations, the frenzy has reached America where there are more than a few guesses about royal baby particulars.

William and Kate are currently prepping for the birth of the second royal baby, which has spurred guesses on the sex and name. Questioning 1713 Brits and 1124 Americans, the survey revealed that after the excitement of a baby boy in blue in 2013, this time around, both desire a baby girl.

Americans instead favour distinctively prominent royal names, with the top three being Diana at 19 per cent, and Elizabeth and Victoria tying at 12 per cent in
