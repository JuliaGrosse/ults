The Queen has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in Windsor Great Park this week. Her Majesty, who is approaching her 89th birthday, was spotted riding her faithful black Fell pony, Carltonlima Emma, as she was joined by Lord Vestey and her Head Groom Terry Pendry in the beautiful park close to her Windsor Castle home on Monday. She was well prepared for any spring showers in a lightweight waterproof, and, as is her wont, eschewed a helmet in favour of one of her silk scarves. Scroll down for video. Outing: The Queen has spent a second day enjoying the spring sunshine in Windsor Great Park this week. On Thursday the Monarch was seen trotting through the park again with Pendry as the sunshine lit up the blooming flora. Today's second riding partner, Lord Vestry, is a close friend of the Royal Family and also the Queen's Master of the Horse, regularly photographed with the Monarch at equestrian events and important ceremonial occasions. The multi-millionaire, 72, is one of Britain's richest men thanks to the Vestey family's estimated £750million fortune through the family meat business, Vestey Foods Group.
