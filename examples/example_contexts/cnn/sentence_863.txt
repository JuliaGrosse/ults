British taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook has confirmed he plans to compete for Moldova at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. Dorset-born Cook, 24, who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has now received his passport from the small eastern European state. 'I will soon begin a new journey representing the Republic of Moldova at all International competitions and hopefully the Rio Olympic games and beyond, should I qualify,' Cook wrote on his Facebook page. Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain Â since May 2012. The British taekwondo star has been granted citizenship by Moldova and plans to fight for them in Rio 2016. 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'I am a fighter at heart and I am not going to throw away 20 years of dedication because of bureaucracy.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, felt he was overlooked for London 2012 - when Lutalo Muhammad, who was selected instead, won bronze - because he decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Cook is aggrieved at being overlooked in favour of Lutalo Muhammad, who won bronze at London 2012. GB Taekwondo has always denied this, but Cook has refused to compete under the British flag since May
