With Saturday's fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao billed as the $300million fight of the century, it's no surprise that its pay-per-view figures look set to blow previous bouts out of the water. In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (£59) and $99.99 (£66) to watch the fight while in Britain, Sky Box Office is offering the bout for £19.99, but those figures will equate to a small fraction of the earnings for Mayweather and Pacquiao. Once ticket sales and casino profits have been considered, the eagerly anticipated mega-fight, which is due to take place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, will become the biggest pay-per-view in sport and could see the two fighters pocket astronomical sums.
