More than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to Syria and Iraq, turning the region into an ‘international finishing school’ for jihadists, an alarming report found.

More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations.
