The police officer accused of murdering Walter Scott will be banned from seeing his first-born child for several months, it was revealed today. Patrol officer Michael Slager will be refused the right to hold the baby which his wife Jamie is set to give birth to in a few weeks. He is only granted video access to his eight and a half month's pregnant wife and an officer stands outside the booth whenever he talks to his family. They are not allowed to spend any time together and contact is via video screens with headphones at the Charleston County jail. But the baby will not be able to enter the South Carolina prison. Before the fall: Patrolman Michael Slager, 33, with his wife Jamie before his arrest. Slager was charged with murder after shooting Walter Scott, 50, after stopping him over a broken tail light in North Charleston, South Carolina. Visit: Michael Slager received a visit at Charleston County Jail last Friday from his pregnant wife and mom. It is deemed unsafe for an infant to enter the prison so Slager will have to rely on photographs as cell phones and access to the internet is forbidden. He will be informed by a telephone call and have to wait to see photographs, which will be examined by officials before being presented to him. When Jamie attended the jail on Friday, she was made to turn through the prison's reception area and take a seat next to a video screen for a talk with him which lasted around two hours. The booths are protected by screens to prevent onlookers
