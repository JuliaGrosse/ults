The ‘Kate effect’ has put a bump in the profits of British fashion house Seraphine with fans flocking to snap up items worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, including this £195 collarless cashmere coat. It has been the Duchess of Cambridge’s label of choice during her two pregnancies. And now the ‘Kate effect’ has put a bump in the profits of British fashion house Seraphine. The online and high street firm has seen sales double in two years since the Duchess was first spotted in one of its outfits. Among the most popular royal choices was a £195 mist-blue collarless cashmere coat with faux pearl buttons. Kate wore the Natasha coat to a series of engagements in Kensington in January and it instantly became such a hit with women – many of whom weren’t even pregnant – that it sold out in most sizes. The firm now sells it with the tagline ‘Worn by the Duchess of Cambridge’ and markets it as suitable for before, during and after pregnancy. Other Seraphine outfits in the Duchess’s wardrobe include the £46 fuchsia wrap dress that she wore in the first official photograph of Prince George nearly two years ago. A different type of Kate effect is being seen outside the maternity unit where she is due to give birth. Fans draped in Union flags and carrying balloons and placards have already set up camp near the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington,
