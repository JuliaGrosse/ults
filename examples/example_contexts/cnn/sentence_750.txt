The real reasons behind what causes knuckles to crack has long been the topic of dispute  among researchers. But a group of scientists from the University of Alberta in Canada claim to have settled the debate once and for all. Their study finds the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones. Research found that the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones. The study also found that the knuckle cracks in less than 310 milliseconds and that immediately before the popping sound there is a white flash, believed to be from water rushing together. The experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – which provides detailed images of internal body structures – and was humorously dubbed by those involved as the ‘pull my finger study.’ Biomedical engineering professor Richard Thompson said: ‘Rapid imaging with MRI was ideal for these studies because it allowed clear visualization of the bones and fluids surrounding them, and critically, the formation of the air cavity.’ One of the study's co-authors, chiropractor Jerome Fryer, was used as the guinea pig for the experiment and lent his own knuckles to the cause. The experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a study co-author's finger. His fingers were individually inserted into a
