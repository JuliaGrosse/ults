Triple tragedy: Archie Brown Jr (pictured) struck and killed a 2-year-old who ran in front of his van in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Sunday evening. While at the scene an unidentified gunman shot Brown and a 15 year old dead. Milwaukee police say the driver of a van who struck and killed a 2-year-old has been shot dead at the scene of the accident - possibly in revenge. A 15-year-old boy was also shot and later died - though it's not clear what his connection to the incident was. Police Captain Timothy Heier says the car accident occurred at 5:10pm Sunday after the child ran into the street in a residential neighborhood on the 4600 block of North 48th Street in Milwaukee. The driver remained at the scene and stayed in his van while police arrived. Before officers could show up, someone opened fire - shooting the driver in the head. He died at the scene. A 15-year-old boy was also shot and later died at the hospital. Police say the teen was not a passenger in the van. The driver's father identified him as father-of-four Archie Brown Jr, to theÂ Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Police are still looking for the person responsible, and so far they have released few details on the tragic incident. Milwaukee Alberman Joe Davis was called to the scene on Sunday and gave statements, indicating the shooting may have been carried out in revenge for the little child's death. Scroll down for video.
