Darren Bent pounced in stoppage time to rescue a 1-1 draw for Derby against Brentford at the iPro Stadium. The Bees controlled the game for long periods after going ahead through Alex Pritchard's brilliant strike - but missed chances in the second half came back to haunt them when Bent grabbed his 10th goal for the Rams. Derby went into the game knowing they needed to win to keep their slim hopes of automatic promotion alive and Tom Ince twice went close in the opening seven minutes. Alex Pritchard celebrates his stunning strike with his Brentford team-mates, after putting his side ahead.
