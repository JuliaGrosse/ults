Luis Suarez (9) has revealed that he once sneaked his way into the Nou Camp for a photograph. He said: 'It was not the first time that I came to Barcelona, it was the second. I went past the official store and saw it, but I did not go in because I didn't have money to buy anything. 'I was already going with Sofía and I remember that I saw an open door and I told her: 'Let's go'. 'You're crazy'. 'Come, just one photo'. 'No, no'. 'Yes, yes, yes. I'm going to go in'. I went in through the door that was open, she followed me and we started to run. 'We stood on the stairs and took a photo with all of the stadium behind us. I still haven't found the photo. Then we ran, and we were nervous. It was the only time that I had entered.
