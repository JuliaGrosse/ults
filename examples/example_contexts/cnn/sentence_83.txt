Janet Faal, who has suffered from agoraphobia for a decade, fell down an uncovered manhole. An agoraphobic grandmother who conquered her fear of open spaces and left home for the third time in 10 years only to fall down a manhole. Janet Faal, 57, was out with a friend in Crawley, West Sussex, as part of her rehabilitation when she moved a wooden pallet to help them reverse and plunged down into the open gap. She now has two black eyes and a suspected fractured leg after smashing her face on the pallet and was left in a'splits' position as only one of her legs went down the hole when she slipped. The grandmother-of-four said: 'I was with a friend helping her reverse out of a car park, and there was this wooden pallet in the way. 'I moved the pallet out of the way with my foot and I was going to turn around to my friend say "is that far enough?". 'I took a step over - never in my life did I think there was a hole underneath, I thought it had just fallen over. The next thing I remember is the pain. It was awful. 'I fell and smashed my face on the pallet, and I was in the hole with blood all over me and I couldn't move.' She reckons she has been set back 'years' in her battle with the debilitating condition, which has left her housebound for
