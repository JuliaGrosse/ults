Disabled children can face a lot of challenges - but one photographer from Washington wants to make sure they recognize that they all have a super-human ability to conquer any challenge set before them. For The Superhero Project, Renee Bergeron, 38, photographs children with special needs as superheroes, dressing them up with capes, goggles, and wands in order to make them feel like they can do anything. 'I think a lot of people look at others with special needs and think of them as "less" in some ways,' Mrs. Bergeron, who also has a parenting blog, recently told The Mighty. 'Let’s face it, though — these kids are all fighters. The obstacles they overcome daily just to cope in our world ought to make us all see them as superheroes.' Caped crusader: Avery, pictured, was photographed for Renee Bergeron's Superhero Project; Avery was born prematurely, has had multiple brain surgeries, and has a feeding tube in her stomach.

Mrs. Bergeron's first little superhero subject was her own son, Apollo, now four. Apollo was diagnosed with a rare heart defect when he was 18 months old and, in addition to undergoing several medical procedures and surgeries, had to be fitted with a feeding tube at a young age.
