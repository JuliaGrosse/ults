Fast food giant Chipotle is making a fresh start and stepping away from using GMOs (genetically modified organisms) as ingredients. Steve Ells, the company's co-CEO and founder, discussed the new development with CNN Money. 'It's relatively easy for us to have all non-GMO ingredients,' he said in the interview. 'I mean, because we don't have many ingredients in the first place.' Scroll down for video. Fresh start: Chipotle co-CEO Steve Ells, pictured, has said 'It's relatively easy for us to have all non-GMO ingredients' Ells added 'You know, we've always paid attention to the way we've sourced food since we started 22 years ago. 'Like artificial colors, additives, preservatives. We'd just rather not be a part of that.' CNNMoney reported that the move marks Chipotle as the first GMO-free national fast food chain. Ells said in the interview that the company has 68 total ingredients and another company's burrito features upwards of 80. Rice, meat marinades, chips, salsa, and tortillas will not be made with GMOs -- with non-GMO corn, sunflower oil and rice bran oil now featuring as ingredients, CNNMoney reported. The New York Times reported that non-GMO canola oil will also be used. Simplified: Ells, seen in a Chipotle kitchen, has said the company has 68 total ingredients --
