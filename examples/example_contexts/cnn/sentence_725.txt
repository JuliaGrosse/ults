March 30, 2014. The slip hasnâ€™t happened and Liverpool are looking strong. They are top of the league with six games to go and only Manchester City are better placed, theoretically, with two games in hand to make up a four-point deficit. There will be a slip, there will be a surge and there will be tears. Theory wins, romance loses. Life at the top, as it was then. Dejected Manchester City players during their 4-2 derby defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. Jubilant Liverpool players celebrate Raheem Sterling's opening goal against Newcastle United on Monday. Man City currently have a four-point lead over Liverpool in the race for the final Champions League place. Today, the last meaningful race among the top teams is between Liverpool and City. But the context is different. Manchester City lead Liverpool by four points and each has played 32 games. The stakes are astonishing, but only because the Champions League is an extremely big deal and they are currently in a pursuit for that last spot in the top four. Times have changed. These days it is Liverpool doing the chasing. They have had their own problems this season but the nitrous balloon has not burst. So, what of Manchester City? The numbers are woefully inadequate. Some examples: City have nine points fewer than at this stage last season; their 4-2 defeat against Manchester United saw them concede four for the first time since 2009; they have lost four of their past six Premier League games
