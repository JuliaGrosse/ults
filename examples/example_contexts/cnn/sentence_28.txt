Many couples disagree over what to name their children — but one New York couple’s battle over their unborn baby’s moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision. Kseniya Soukeras, who is due in August, wants to name her unborn child Michael, after her late father. Her husband Nicholas prefers the Greek name Spyridon, after his own father. Because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately, the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision; Nicholas, 37, has launched an online petition asking for help to sway his wife. Baby name showdown: Nicholas and Kseniya Soukeras can't agree over whether to name their child Spyridon or Michael, which Nicholas says his wife will shorten to Mischa. 'The argument is serious — it’s not a joke,' Kseniya, 33, told the New York Post. 'I don’t want to call my son something I can’t even pronounce.' According to the petition, Kseniya finds the name Spyridon 'archaic, base, bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century America'. But Nicholas argues that his wife simply has not had the opportunity to grow to like the name, and that her 'Russian ear is not trained for the sweet, musical sounds of our Greek nomenclature'.
