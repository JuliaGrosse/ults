The novelist, who died in 2014 aged 90, amassed a spectacular collection of Greek, Egyptian and Roman jewellery during her lifetime, among them pieces up to 3,500 years old. Now the collection is to go under the hammer, with auctioneers saying they expect the exquisite pieces to fetch up to £20,000. Collector: Elizabeth Jane Howard, pictured with Kingsley Amis, collected ancient jewellery. Howard, a former model who became the second wife of Lucky Jim novelist Kingsley Amis in 1965, adored historic jewellery and, despite its great age, was regularly photographed in it.
