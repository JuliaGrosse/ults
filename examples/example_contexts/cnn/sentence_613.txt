Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the biggest surprises for many a Formula One season with the team's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia. Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in first practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. The Mercedes driver, who leads the championship, set the pace as he bids to win his fourth race in China. Hamilton was over half-a-second clear of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in opening practice. 1. Lewis Hamilton  Mercedes 1:39.033. 2. Nico Rosberg  Mercedes 1:39.574. 3.
