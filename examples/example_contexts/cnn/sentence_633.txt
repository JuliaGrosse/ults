PC Ronnie Lungu has won a race discrimination case against Wiltshire Police. A black police constable has won a race discrimination case against his force after they did not promote him due to the colour of his skin. Ronnie Lungu was singled out as 'a marked man' by Wiltshire Police solely due to his race, the employment tribunal ruled. It found the 40-year-old was passed over for promotion in favour of white colleagues after his internal assessments were secretly downgraded to make him appear unworthy. It also heard evidence that derogatory comments were made about Mr Lungu based on his colour violating his dignity. When the PC raised concerns with his superiors they were not taken seriously and his complaints were brushed off as trivial. The force - which has only 16 ethnic minority officers out of a total of just over 1,000 - had denied the claims. But the tribunal ruled that the Zimbabwe-born officer was unlawfully discriminated against on grounds of race. Mr Lungu said: 'When I realised I was being singled out and treated badly because of the colour of my skin I felt so angry and upset. 'I had worked all my career to serve the community and be the best police officer I could but I was being penalised because I was black. 'It was totally unacceptable. But what made matters worse was that when I did raise the issue internally it wasn't taken seriously.' The tribunal in Bristol was told that the father-of-three joined the force as a police constable
