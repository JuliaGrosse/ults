So who will be voted PFA Player of the Year? Eden Hazard is the hot favourite but whoever wins will have plenty of tactical voting to thank. I’m sure Hazard and the other leading contenders — in my mind David de Gea and Harry Kane — will benefit from their team-mates being careful with who they vote for. John Terry recently revealed he had chosen Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho — who has been very good but not great — as his nomination. There’s no way Terry can seriously believe Coutinho has been better than De Gea and Kane this season! There is more to it than meets the eye. John, I am almost certain, will have gone around Chelsea’s dressing room when the ballot papers came in and told the squad — given that you cannot choose one of your team-mates — under no circumstances should they vote for De Gea or Kane, who are Hazard’s biggest challengers. I’m sure the same happened in the Spurs and United dressing rooms. Chelsea winger Eden Hazard is among the front runners to win the PFA Player of the Year award this season. The Belgium international has been in superb form for Jose Mourinho's side as they look set to win the title. Hazard will have to beat off competition from Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. Harry Kane is another of the favourites to pick up the individual gong after his heroics for Tottenham. How do I know? I did exactly the same thing in 2006
