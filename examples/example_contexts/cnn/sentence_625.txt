The legal proceedings alone cost $5.5 million before the trial of the shooter, James Eagan Holmes, had even started.

That figure is more than Apple's annual revenue of $174 billion and the cost of the obesity epidemic, which is $224 billion.

At least 750,000 Americans have been injured by guns over the last 10 years. While gun-related deaths seem to be decreasing, with 33,000 each year, gun-related violence is increasing, with 80,000 injured in 2012. Mother Jones reported the rise of gun-related violence to
