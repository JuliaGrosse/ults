Sportswomen tend to be more committed to aspects of their lives outside sport - such as their academic studies - than their male counterparts, the researchers say.

Great Britain's Mo Farah is pictured above running to victory in the European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland. This may explain why boys are often seen as being more competitive. However, the researchers say that there can be a great deal of individual variability with some women actually showing greater competitive drive than most male athletes. Many reasons have been suggested to explain why women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies. Now, a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics, by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office, women like to be part of a team. The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team’s. Researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team. They found that less
