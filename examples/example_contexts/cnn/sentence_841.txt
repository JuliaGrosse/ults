Prince Harry will go on tough bush patrols and take part in 'indigenous engagement' programmes during his four-week secondment with Australian Defence Force, Kensington Palace has revealed. The prince is due to arrive in Australia on the 6th April and will split his time between capital Canberra, Sydney, Darwin and Perth. On arrival, Harry will be taken straight to the Australian War Memorial on arrival before heading to barracks to report for duty. On his way: Harry will deploy to Australia next week and will begin with a visit to the Australian War Memorial. Last trip: Harry last headed Down Under in 2013 when he took part in Navy celebrations. First though, he will pay his respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where he will be joined by Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove. Afterwards, the 30-year-old will tour the World War I and Afghanistan galleries before meeting members of the public. Harry will then report to Australia's defence chief, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, and army boss Lieutenant General David Morrison for duty. 'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' said a source. 'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.' News of Harry's deployment Down Under emerged two weeks ago, when Kensington Palace announced that the prince would be ending his army career
