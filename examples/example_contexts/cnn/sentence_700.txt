With a Steyr assault rifle pulled tight into his shoulder, the Prince is pictured taking part in exercises with Royal Australian Artillery troops in Darwin. Harry’s participation in the exercises follows his visit to the remote Kununurra region of Western Australia where he met village elders and children, camped in the Outback and was taught how to survive a bushfire.

'Delightful chap': Prince Harry takes time out from his tough training programme to play with local children at the Wuggubun community in a remote area hundreds of miles away from the nearest city, Darwin. As well as demonstrating his weapons handling and first aid skills, the 30-year-old took to the air in the Royal Australian Air Force’s Tiger assault helicopter, which is similar to the Apache the Prince flew in combat sorties against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2012. At the end of the exercises in the Northern Territory, Prince Harry will hang up his fatigues and, after attending official functions in Perth and Sydney, is expected to return to Britain. In July, the Prince is scheduled to spend several weeks on a conservation project in Africa before finally deciding on a fulltime job, most probably in the charity or public service sectors.
