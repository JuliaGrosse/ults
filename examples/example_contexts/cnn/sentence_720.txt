It has spent four years orbiting the closest planet to our sun, but despite desperate attempts to extend the life of Messenger spacecraft, it is slowly spiraling towards Mercury's scorched surface. Yet even as its mission draws to an end, the final weeks of Nasa's Messenger spacecraft are revealing the planet in unrivaled detail. Messenger is currently 18 miles (29.1km) above Mercury after Nasa engineers used the last of its fuel in a last ditch effort to push the spacecraft higher into orbit after it dropped to within nine miles (15km) of the surface. Among the images sent back by Messenger as its mission draws to an end is this picture of 2km high cliffs cutting through the Carnegie crater. They are thought to have formed as Mercury has cooled and contracted. The spacecraft, however, is expected to smash into the planet's surface on 30 April. But as messenger drops ever closer to Mercury's surface, it is sending back some of the most detailed images ever obtained of the smallest planet in our solar system. Researchers have uncovered the mystery of Mercury's'stealth' colour scheme. The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury black over billions of years. It solves the mystery of Mercury's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists. On average, Mercury is much darker than its closest airless neighbour, our Moon. Airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind, processes that create a
