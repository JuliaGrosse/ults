How do you fancy taking a tour of the Grand Mosque of Abu Dhabi, seeing Berlin's historic Checkpoint Charlie or exploring Cape Peninsula in South Africa? You can now have a real holiday 'e-xperience' from the comfort of your own home, and importantly, for a fraction of the price. Park Inn by Radisson has today announced the launch of a pioneering, new virtual travel service which redefines the concept of 'holiday'. The Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is definitely a sight worth seeing. E-scapes is the world's first 'virtual holiday' experience on social media – allowing customers to appear to be on a trip away according to their social channels, whilst actually still at home. For just the fraction of the price of a traditional 'holiday', the holidays take management of an individual's social media profiles and 'transports' them away on the 'e-trip' of a lifetime. While E-scape customers are relaxing at home, their social media accounts - including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat – are updated to give the illusion they're on a trip away. To create these 'e-experiences', a dedicated team of social media specialists prepare a tailored itinerary of airport check-ins, status updates and attendance at all the best destination hotspots and events. The famous Checkpoint Charlie was the famous Berlin Wall crossing between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. In addition, E-scapes' designers use cutting-edge photo manipulation software
