It seems there is nothing that Vivienne Westwood cannot transform, especially after she recently added a luxury penthouse hotel suite to her impressive design portfolio. Following her venture redesigning flight attendant uniforms for Virgin Atlantic last year, the talented designer has turned her hand to the hotel business. Breaking records for the largest suite in Los Angeles, the Westwood-designed penthouse at The London West Hollywood hotel is set to open next month, and it will cost a eye-watering $25,000 (almost £17,000) a night. The master bedroom suite includes a contemporary king-sized four poster bed, with cushions and a tapestry designed by Westwood. Wouldn't say no! The luxurious bathroom from the designer hotel suite in LA provides the perfect retreat. Fashion-conscious travellers will not be disappointed as the 10th-floor penthouse - measuring 11,000 square feet with two levels - will feature  exclusive art, decor and custom furnishings, created in collaboration with Richmond Design. Guests can spot Westwood-designed prints, tiles and even scarves in the LA suite, before spending an hour of exclusive private shopping at the Vivienne Westwood store in West Hollywood, with an added discount. If this was not enough to tempt Westwood fans, they will even receive his and her gift bags upon arrival. The English designer has waved her magic wand over the suite, with many furnishings featuring the iconic Westwood pattern. What a view! Enjoy celebrating on
