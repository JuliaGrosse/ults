'Toxic': Celebrity Big Brother contestant Katie Hopkins said migrant vessels 'need pushing back' Katie Hopkins was today branded 'toxic' after saying boats in North Africa should be 'burned' to cut immigration - just hours after up to 900 migrants drowned in the Mediterranean Sea. The 40-year-old former Celebrity Big Brother contestant said the vessels ‘need pushing back’ and asked listeners to a radio show: ‘Why do we take on everyone else's problem?’ Miss Hopkins said on LBC yesterday: 'I, for one, believe we should turn back the boats. Personally I would use gunships, I would tow them back to where they came from, and I would make a huge bonfire of all the boats they have - in order that we put a stop to this ridiculous situation that we find ourselves in.' Her comments were labelled 'dangerous', while she was described as a'manifestation of the culture of toxic hate that is prevalent in the UK'. More than 900 people are feared dead after the fishing boat overturned in the Mediterranean at midnight yesterday in one of the worst maritime disasters since the Second World War ended. And the former Apprentice contestant insisted a 'huge bonfire' should be made from boats in North Africa so they cannot be used again. She added: ‘If you allow these boats to come that number will grow year on year. When we see these migrants arriving in Italy, they aren't just staying in Italy. �
