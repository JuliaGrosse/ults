Scientists say they have found 50 galaxies  that may contain intelligent alien races. These galaxies were found to be emitting ‘unusually high’ levels of radiation - possibly indicating ‘the presence of a highly advanced civilisation.’ Within these galaxies, the researchers said it was possible that an alien race could be harnessing the power of the stars - emitting huge amounts of noticeable heat in the process. Pennsylvania scientists have found evidence that we may not be alone. They found 50 galaxies emitting unusually high levels of radiation. This could be because aliens are harnessing the power of  stars. However, further research is needed to confirm that is the case. Shown is Arp 220, one promising galaxy candidate. The study was led by Dr Jason Wright from the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds at Penn State University in Pennsylvania. The Glimpsing Heat from Alien Technologies Survey (G-Hat), published in the Astrophysical Journal, details how the team thought they might see the infrared signature of a race far more advanced than ours. A proposed method for harnessing the power of an entire star is known as a Dyson sphere. First proposed by theoretical physicist freeman Dyson in 1960, this would be a swarm of satellites that surrounds a star. They could be an enclosed shell, or spacecraft spread out to gather its energy - known as a Dyson swarm. If such structures do exist, they would emit huge amounts of noticeable infrared radiation back on Earth. But as
