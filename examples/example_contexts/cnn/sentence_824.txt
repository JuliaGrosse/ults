Breakthrough?: Early tests carried out on cancer cells (like the one pictured) have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent. A new technique that effectively gives a personal treatment for cancer has been found by scientists. It harnesses the power of the body’s immune system and targets it at tumours. Early experiments have demonstrated that the new method could revolutionise cancer care. Scientists have found a system of priming the body’s immune system to recognise, attack and kill off cancerous cells in lung, skin and bowel tumours. The team which carried out the research found that early trials ‘profoundly retarded’ tumour growth in mice. Survival rates were boosted by more than 50 per cent, according to results published in the journal Nature last night. The scientists are now recruiting patients with skin cancer for the first clinical trial on humans. British experts said it is the most promising sign yet that ‘personal’ treatments may be effective in treating a wide range of cancers. Until now most cancer drugs have been designed according to the type of tumour they are attacking – a broad-brush approach in which the type of drug is selected depending on the body part in which the tumour is sited. But the new focus on personal cancer therapy instead aims to harness each individual’s immune system and give it a boost depending on the genetic make-up of the tumour itself. The ground-breaking technique may provide a universal
