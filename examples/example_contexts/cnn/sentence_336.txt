Sophie Wilson performed CPR on Bradley Wilson. A teenage girl has told how she  saved the life of a childhood friend who attempted suicide after months of bullying. Sophie Wilson, 17, performed CPR on Bradley Parkes after she and a friend found him hanging from a tree in the woods near his home inÂ Willenhall, in Coventry. The 16-year-old was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital in a coma but yesterday his mother Tiffany, 35, revealed he had made a'miracle' recovery, as she thanked the girls. Sophie and Katie Alwill, 18, raised the alarm and summoned help after they stumbled across the teenager during a woodland walk. 'Someone burned the rope free from the tree using a lighter,' said Miss Wilson. 'He wasn't breathing and his pulse was very weak. 'I learned CPR at school and I started doing chest compressions and mouth to mouth. 'He started breathing again but it was more snorting than breathing. 'I'm in shock and it still hasn't hit me that this actually happened. It feels like it isn't real.' Miss Wilson revealed how Bradley had grown up in the house opposite her and they went to primary school together. 'He's a really nice lad and I've never heard a bad word said about him. I didn't know he was being bullied. I don't think he told anyone.' Ms Parkes, a mother-of-five, told yesterday how her son was making progress.
