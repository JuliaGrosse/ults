Thomas, 42, a referee for college football's Conference USA, has been considered before for a position in the NFL before she was chosen to start in the league next year, Baltimore reporter Aaron Wilson posted on his Twitter account. She has previously refereed preseasons games, scrimmages and minicamps after becoming part of the NFL's training program since 2013.

The NFL would not confirm Thomas's hiring on Friday, saying in a statement: 'The 2015 roster of officials has not yet been finalized. When it is, the new officials for 2015 and the entire roster will be announced.' Thomas will be among eight new hires made for the 2015 season, a source close to the matter told the LA Times. A Brandon, Mississippi, native, Thomas played basketball at University of Mobile before beginning officiating after attending a meeting with her brother. 'He told me there’s a bunch of old men sitting there. And that I might get some strange stares,' she told the Hattiesburg American last year
