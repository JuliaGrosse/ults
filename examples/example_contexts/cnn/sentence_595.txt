Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to abide by the commitments of a nuclear agreement that promises to end years of crippling sanctions. Residents danced in the streets, blared their horns and joyously waved their national flag following the breakthrough deal. The agreement between Iran and the West, struck after a 12-year stand-off, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Mr Rouhani also called on world powers to fulfil their part of the deal. Speaking after the announcement he said: 'Everything we promised in the nuclear talks... we will remain loyal to and stand by our promises. 'The world must know that we do not intend to cheat.' David Cameron and Barack Obama insisted the deal was'strong'. The marathon talks between Iran and the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva, had run over their deadline by more than two days with many fearing a deal was not possible. But last night, the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini announced Iran had agreed to restrictions on its enrichment of material that can be used either for energy production or in nuclear warheads. Under its terms, IranÂ would scale down plans to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium in return for Western powers dropping stringent economic sanctions. They will also be subjected to inspections.
