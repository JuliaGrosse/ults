A Chinese hospital is being painstakingly moved just eight metres a day on 1,000 metal rollers  to prevent it from being demolished to make way for a new road. The building, which was built in the 1960s and belongs to Zheng Gong Hospital in Henan Province, was under threat of demolition as it is situated in the path of a road expansion project, reportsÂ People's Daily Online. But hospital bosses decided to save time and money - and avoid paying for a new building - and employed a team of engineers to put 'wheels' on the building. The two-storey brick hospital outpatient building in China is being rolled every day on giant metal 'wheels' The large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and needs more than 1,000 wheels to 'roll' it. Now, the two-storey hospital outpatient building in the city of Zhengzhou, in central China, is being slowly and carefully pushed just a few metres a day on the giant cylinder-shaped rollers. The engineers aim to 'push' the entire structure south by 17.5 metres to its new, designated spot, away from the demolition zone. The 'wheels' the building is being moved on are large, cylinder-shaped metal rollers. The People's Daily reports the large brick building is 1,700 square metres in size and requires more than 1,000 wheels to make the daily 'walk' possible.
