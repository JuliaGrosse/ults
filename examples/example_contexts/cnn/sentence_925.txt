A few blocks from the finish line and even closer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 Boston Marathon, race organizers are building a combination clubhouse, interactive museum and retail store that, for the first time, gives them a year-round, public presence. The Boston RunBase scheduled to open April 16 will allow visitors to learn about the world's most prestigious road race, run a replica of the course on a treadmill or see artifacts from its 118-year history. It will give runners a place to gather before going for a jog by the Charles River, and then shower and change before heading back to work or to the convention center across the street. Construction: Joe Clifford paints the ceiling of RunBase near the 26-mile mark of the Boston Marathon, in Boston on Wednesday. Champion: A gold laurel wreath, which is awarded to the winner of the Boston Marathon, is displayed at the Boston Athletic Association. The wreath, and other historic items from the race, will be on display when RunBase opens later in April. Location: RunBase is just a few blocks from the marathon finish line, and even nearer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 race. Runners are seen here during the 2013 Boston Marathon. If they want to pick up a pair of shoes or a Boston Marathon jacket, they can do that, too. 'This RunBase is the front door,' Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said this
