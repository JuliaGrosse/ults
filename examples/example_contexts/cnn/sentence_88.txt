My first trip to New York was with my aunt when I was about 18 and I had been appearing in Coronation Street for about 12 months. I can remember it all so clearly. We had a lot of fun together - we went to see the musical Chicago on Broadway and did lots and lots of shopping. We returned to the city that never sleeps in January 2001, eight months before the terrible events of 9/11, and one of the first things my boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon and I did on my latest trip was to visit the site of the World Trade Center to see the monument to those who died. It was a very poignant moment. Coronation Street star Samia Ghadie and boyfriend Sylvain Longchambon take a selfie in New York. There were hundreds of people visiting the memorial at the time but everybody was quiet and extremely respectful. Sylvain and I flew to the US from Manchester and spent four nights in the city. I love flying from Manchester if I can, not just because it's nearer to my home but because it's not so vast and sprawling as either Gatwick or Heathrow. We stayed at the Marriott where the service was fantastic - when we checked in the concierge desk wanted to know if they could help us to make bookings for shows or restaurants. And when we got to the room, we were met by a butler who immediately took away our shoes for shining - very impressive. You don't get that at
