Despite the size of the statues, Sean Hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the University of Oregon, believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy. ‘It seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it, either by levering or rolling,’ he told the 80th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology.

Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents. A tall order: Physicists believe that the pukao,
