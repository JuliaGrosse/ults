A real-life Willy Wonka has laid claim to making the most extravagant chocolate creation - a seven-foot-tall, five-foot-wide Easter Egg made using 352lbs (160kg) of chocolate. Jan Hansen's egg is so big that it took him three days to put together and is made from layers of Belgian chocolate which covers an iron frame. The creation had to be completed using a step ladder and is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars. Jan Hansen with his 7ft tall Easter egg which he will sell off in pieces to raise money for St Barnabas Hospice. Mr Hansen hopes to raise £1,000  from the sale of the egg for St Barnabas Hospice. The giant treat, which has since been wrapped in cellophane complete with a bow on top, was made with melted chocolate which had to be tempered overnight. The 58-year-old chocolatier commissioned an iron worker to make a special frame for his egg, which was then wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film, before being covered in chocolate. Due to the nature of chocolate contracting after it cools, Mr Hansen had to add layer upon layer of chocolate using a palette knife over a three-day period. He then finished the egg off using a 'rough bark' finish. Mr Hansen, who has been in the chocolate business for almost three decades, currently has the egg on display at his shop Hansen's Chocolate House in Folkingham,
