San Barnaba is a deconsecrated Baroque-style, Roman Catholic church, located on Corso Magenta #44, near Piazzale Arnaldo, in Brescia, region of Lombardy, Italy. The church in the 20th century became an auditorium (Auditorium San Barnaba) and conference hall, and home of the Conservatorio Luca Marenzio.

History
The church was originally built in 1299 under the patronage of the Bishop Berardo Maggi. It is said the church was erected atop a pagan temple to Hercules. By 1302 it was affiliated with an Augustinian order convent. The Augustinians were expelled from Brescia in 1457, and replaced by a Comunità dell’Osservanza di Lombardia, which in 1490 performs reconstructions including adding an adjacent library, where Giovanni Pietro da Cemmo frescoed the Life of St Augustine on the ceiling
