The Poite 3 was a one-off, all metal touring aircraft which seated two in tandem. It was built and flown in France in 1931.

Design and development

The factory of S. Poite was well known to French aircraft manufacturers for its expertise in welded light metal structures, particularly their fuel tanks but also fuselage frames such as that of the Bodiansky 20. The Poite 3 is the only known aircraft carrying the factory's name. It was designed by M. TÃ©tart and was an all-metal aircraft.

The Poite 3 had a three part, low, cantilever wing, built around twin spars and having a high aspect ratio (10.8). There was a rectangular centre-section which filled about one quarter of the span and almost triangular outer panels which carried light dihedral and tapered in thickness. Its ailerons occupied about half the trailing edges of the outer panels and increased in chord inboard.
