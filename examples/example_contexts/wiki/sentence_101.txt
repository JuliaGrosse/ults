Eugène Le Roy (; 29 November 1836, Hautefort – 6 May 1907, Montignac, Dordogne) was a French author.

Early life
Eugène Le Roy was born in 1836 in Hautefort, a commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. His parents were servants to Ange Hyacinthe Maxence de Damas de Cormaillon, Baron de Damas, a former minister who owned the Château de Hautefort. The circumstances there forced them to leave Le Roy with a nurse at a peasant's house in the neighborhood. His childhood memories strongly influenced his future work, which featured many storylines with abandoned children. This was an undeniable social reality of the time that later became one of the clichés of the era's popular romances.

From 1841 to 1847, Le Roy studied at a rural school
