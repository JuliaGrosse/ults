History 

The complex of Vihara Dharma Bhakti was erected in 1650 under the order of Luitenant der Chinezen Kwee Hoen. The temple was named Kwan Im Teng in Hokkien or Guānyīn tíng in Mandarin (觀音亭), literally "Pavilion of Guanyin", to honor Kwan Im whom the temple is dedicated to. The name Kwan Im Teng is the origin of the word klenteng itself,
