Juan de Prado (c. 1563 – 24 May 1631) was a Spanish Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Order of Friars Minor.  He served as part of the missions in Muslim Morocco at the request of Pope Urban VIII and brought much solace to the small Christian population there before the ruler had him murdered.

Pope Benedict XIII confirmed his beatification in mid-1728 after confirming that the priest had been murdered in hatred of his Christian faith.
