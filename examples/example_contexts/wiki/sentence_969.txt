Richard Francis Newland (died 1 August 1873) was a banker and politician in the colony of South Australia, appointed as an acting non-official member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, serving from January 1847 to July 1847.

History
Newland was manager of the Sydney branch of the Bank of Australasia and in January 1839 was appointed to the same position at the Adelaide branch of the Bank. He resigned in 1843, and at the urging of Hon. John Baker took up a sheep station either on the River Gilbert or the River Light, where he had a flock of 12,000 sheep, whose wool commanded record prices.

He was appointed to the Legislative Council in January 1847 while John Morphett was absent on leave.
He succeeded Samuel Davenport as appointed non-official member of the Legislative Council.

In 1850 he succeeded G. F. Dashwood as Stipendiary and Special Magistrate at Port Adelaide.
