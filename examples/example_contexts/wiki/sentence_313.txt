HMS Lorna was a British armed yacht which served in the Royal Navy. Originally built in 1904 as a luxury steam yacht, she served in both the First and Second World Wars and destroyed a German U-boat in 1918. After the war, she became a passenger vessel in Greece, but sank in 1966 and was scrapped two years later.

History

Luxury yacht
The vessel was completed in October 1904 at Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Greenock on the River Clyde in Scotland and was named Beryl. She had been ordered by Wyndham Francis Cook, the son of Francis Cook, 1st Viscount of Monserrate, a wealthy textiles merchant; however, Wyndham died in May 1905. It was purchased in that year by the shipbuilder, John Burns, 1st Baron Inverclyde, and in 1911 to Samuel Morley, 1st Baron Hollenden, a former Governor of the Bank of England,
