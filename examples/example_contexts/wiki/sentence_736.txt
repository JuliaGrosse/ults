Women in agriculture in China make up a diverse group of women who support agricultural activities in their country. Because China is a large country, rural women should not be considered a monolithic group, but instead have different strategies for success based on group or family relationships.

History 

Based on Confucian principals, farming was an expression of "moral worth" for men of all social classes in China while weaving and creating textiles was a way for women to show their worth in society. Traditionally, "women were subordinated to men," and although men had primary responsibility for the farm, women were certainly involved in farming in the early Chinese economy. During the Han dynasty, women's contributions to agriculture in China increased, most likely due to the innovation and popularization of the pit-farming method. Textile creation, which relied on help and silk, was also considered by early Chinese to be an "agricultural product" rather than a separate craft.
