Uncanny Magazine is an American science fiction and fantasy online magazine, edited and published by Lynne M. Thomas and Michael Damian Thomas, based in Urbana, Illinois. Its mascot is a space unicorn.

The editors-in-chief, who originally edited Apex Magazine from 2012â€“2013, chose the name of the magazine because they say it "has a wonderful pulp feel", and like how the name evokes the unexpected. They created the magazine "in the spirit of pulp sci-fi mags popular in the 1960s and '70s."

Uncanny has been published bimonthly, beginning in November 2014, after receiving initial funding through Kickstarter. It continues to fund itself through crowdfunding as well as subscriptions, which numbered 4,000 in 2017.

The magazine publishes original works by authors such as Neil Gaiman, Elizabeth Bear, Paul Cornell, Catherynne M. Valente, Charlie Jane Anders, Seanan McGuire, Mary Robin
