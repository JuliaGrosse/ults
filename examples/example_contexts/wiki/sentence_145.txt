Wolfsberg Castle (), today also Henckel-Donnersmarck Castle (Schloss Henckel-Donnersmarck), stands on a knoll in the north of the town of Wolfsberg in the Austrian state of Carinthia.

History 

The property was owned by the Bishopric of Bamberg from 1007. The castle itself was mentioned for the first time in 1178 in a document from Saint Paul's Abbey. It was the prerequisite for the development of the eponymous settlement, which rose to town status in 1289. From the second quarter of the 14th century until the sale of the entire Bamberg estate in Carinthia to the Austrian state in 1759, the castle served as the residence of the vice-dominus, who represented the bishop in the local issues. The building, consisting of two irregular, interconnected wings, was converted by Italian architects in the 16th century into a fortress to guard against the approaching Turks. At
