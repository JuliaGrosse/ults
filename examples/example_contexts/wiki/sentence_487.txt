Bald Hills is a locality in central Victoria, Australia, in the Hepburn Shire local government area,  west of the state capital, Melbourne, and  north of Ballarat. The area is about  above sea level.

The area is dominated by large volcanic hills, including Mount Blowhard, Mount Pisgah, Mount Hollowback and Mount Cavern. These hills gave the area its name:
These rounded mound-like hills are thickly dotted over the surface, at times there being fully a score of them in view at once. They are almost bare of trees, and have been named by the bushmen "bald hills."

Balds Hills also at one time had a railway station on the still operating Ballarat - Creswick - Maryborough line (station now closed and no evidence exists) and several hotels (all closed).

Gold mining
The area was the site of several gold mines between 1860 and 1900, and there is still evidence
