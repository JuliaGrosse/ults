The Blue Water Bridge Authority was a Canadian Crown corporation responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Canadian side of the Blue Water Bridge in Point Edward, Ontario.  It was established on May 21, 1964 via the Blue Water Bridge Authority Act (Canada), which authorized it to provide highway traffic between Canada and the United States over the Blue Water Bridge.  It was granted exclusive rights to levy tolls on westbound traffic from Canada to the United States in order to offset the costs of operation, maintenance, and construction.

On April 26, 2002, the Authority became a Schedule III, Part I parent Crown corporation.  It was not required to pay taxes and not eligible to receive appropriations.  In September 2007, in accordance with Federal Identity Program requirements, the organization was officially titled Blue Water Bridge Canada.

On February 1, 2015, via House Government Bill C-4 Section 8 (assented to on December 12, 2013), the Blue Water Bridge Authority was amalgamated with St
