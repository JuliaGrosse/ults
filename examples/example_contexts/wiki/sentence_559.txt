Hannah Dadds ( Head, 16 October 1941 – 5 December 2011) was a British train driver known for being the first female train driver on the London Underground.

Early life
Hannah Dadds (née Head) was from the Forest Gate area of Newham. Her mother was a home help and her father worked in the furniture trade. After leaving school at 15, she worked as a shop assistant at the Co-op, and later in the Bryant and May match factory and the Kensitas cigarette factory.

London Underground career
In 1969, Dadds joined the London Underground, working as a 'railwoman' at Upton Park Underground station. She then worked as a ticket collector and in 1976 she became a train guard. Train guards were also emergency drivers in case something happened to the driver or if there was an accident. While male guards could train further in order to become a driver, female guards could not. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 removed this barrier
