TITLE: [25\M] heard through the grapevine that my FWB [24\F] has three more FWBs. Not sure if I want to continue
POST: A while back I moved to a new city because I got a job there, and I visit my old town a few times per year. In my old town I have a FWB (friend with benefits) that I ocassionally hook up with. Now I'm back in my old time for Christmas and I heard through the grapevine that my FWB has had sex with 5 people since I was here in november, and that she has sex with 2 or 3 of those 5 people on a regular basis. 

Now I'm not really sure that I want to see her anymore. I know she is very careful with protection and checks herself for STDs after every encounter. But it still feels wrong to be a part of a harem, or whatever it would be. If it's true that I'm the 4th guy who bones her I don't know if I'm fine with that. 

Is it wrong of me to end my FWB arrangement with this girl because I don't want to be nr. 4? She has pursued a relationship with me in the past but I rejected her because I couldn't see a future with her, so it's not because of jelousy. If I wanted her all for myself, I could have that. But with her, I really just want sex so. Body tells me to continue, Brain tells me No.
TL;DR:
