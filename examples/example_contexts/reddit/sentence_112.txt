TITLE: My girlfriend (20/F) broke up with me(22/M) because she turned lesbian
POST: So, after 5 months she figured out she likes girls. She's been thinking about that for a long time and after meeting a certain girl, she decided she is more happy with girls rather than boys.

Now, the problem is that I lost a soul mate. She is the first to understand my problems, first that I opened up to, not just as a girlfriend, but as a person. She knows more about me than my parents. All that I had planned is now lost, I am lost, I don't know what to do and how to deal with this. I am too emotional to just forget some one that I loved with all of my heart, and even tho she did all of this to me, I still love her and care for her.
Reddit, what should I do? How do I get over this? I've taken some pills to calm myself down, but I don't want to be on pills...
