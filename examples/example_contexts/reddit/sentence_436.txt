TITLE: I (20F) am trying to move past my boyfriend (22M) cheating. Advice?
POST: I found out about this about 3 weeks ago. Here's the story. There's plenty more details, but this is what I think is important.

Me and my boyfriend of over a year had been fighting on a Wednesday night, it was particularly nasty due to a bout of depression on my side. But after sleeping on it we have always been good in the morning. I was under the impression that this was the case on Thursday.

Apparently he thought we were still fighting and on the verge of breaking up. I went home for the weekend (we're in college) and he figured we would break up as soon as I got back. So in his mind we were as good as done.

I guess he went on Tinder looking for someone to talk to just so he could feel wanted and not alone. What was supposed to be a walk around the block turned into him kissing her and then making out in a bush for 10 minutes. Just kissing, I know, but **** it still hurts.

He says it was awful and he regretted it as soon as it was over. And he's had 2 months to think about it and try to make up for it without me even knowing about it. He's explained why and told me everything I wanted to know. I only found out because I saw messages between them on Facebook.

Before this happened, we were talking about getting engaged, and it's come up again since I found out because we both still want to be together, I'm just having a really hard time moving past what happened and learning to trust him again.

I never expected this from him, it was the one thing he swore would never happen and I trusted him 100%. Now he says it will absolutely never happen again, but every time I think about what happened I feel sick. What can I do to feel better, or should I even be trying to make things with him work?
TL;DR:
