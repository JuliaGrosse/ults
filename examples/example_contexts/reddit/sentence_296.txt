TITLE: Need some advice
POST: A little background  ever since I was little I was always the fat kid who could probably run faster than you.  I've always been into sports  but stayed chubby.  I guess I was never motivated to do anything about losing the fat until I decided to join a soccer team.  After a year I had changed so much I felt good even with the little gut I had. It didn't last long though :( It all went downhill again when I hurt my knee.  I wasn't able to run without a pulsating pain going through my knee.  I tried to work through the pain but  had given up and fell into depression.  I went to physical therapy and it helped out but now I can't seem to find the motivation to do something.  I'll always waste my time and when it's too late say ughhh I'll do it tomorrow in the morning, hit the snooze button in the morning and say i'll do it in the evening and well you know.
TL;DR:
