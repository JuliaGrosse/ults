TITLE: Me [22M] and my crush/friend[25F] met on an exchange, tell her my feelings before we leave?
POST: Situation:

So we are both college students on an exchange in an East-Asian country, both from (different) western countries. The exchange has lasted for 4 months now and the end is near for both of us. 

She has a boyfriend in another city in the same Asian country, but doesn't like to talk about him and she sees their relationship as 'disposable'. Still, the fact that she has a boyfriend refrained me from flirting with her or telling her about my feelings for her.

I had a small crush on her since we met, but we became close friends pretty fast and told each other our histories and personal thoughts. As I got to know her, my feelings for her grew, but it's obvious she doesn't have the same feelings for me. 

My feelings for her have gotten to the point that it's hard to keep inside anymore, I just want her to know how I feel about her, but at the same time I think she will be upset if she hears I had a crush on her all the time. I want to make it clear to her in a way that showes her that I do appreciate our friendship.

So my question is:

As I won't see her ever again after this semester anyway, shall I tell her about my feelings for her, or do I need to keep them for myself? I prefer to tell her, but that might be just selfish/to relieve myself.
TL;DR:
