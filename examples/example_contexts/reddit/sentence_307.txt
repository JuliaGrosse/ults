TITLE: Me [21M] getting mixed responses from someone I've been flirting and hang out with. [19 F]
POST: So, I'm the president of a roleplaying/board game club here at my university, and recently a new girl joined our club a month ago and I've started to grow pretty fond of her. We have a lot of the same interests and she has a very nice, albeit a sarcastic personality, but that's all the better for me because it rolls with my personality as well.

Anyways, I started flirting with her and we've gone ice skating together once, but I'm not certain if she is entirely into it. I've asked her to go on a date with me on Valentine's Day to the movies to go see Deadpool, but she said that she had too much homework to do so (Which makes sense, our school gives a lot of work) and I did ask her only two days before Valentine's Day. I asked her if she'd be willing to 

I did get her a carnation delivered to her door on Valentine's Day (I usually get one for all my close friends so its not too out of the ordinary, although I have only known her for a month)

So right now, we still talk and I'm really unsure of where I should go from here. I can't tell her if she isn't interested in me romantically and just want to stay friends, but I'm getting mixed signals so I'm uncertain of what to do here. I don't know whether I should just backoff and just move on, or to proceed. I feel like I put the ball in her court to respond, but these mixed responses are making me confused on where to go from here.
TL;DR:
