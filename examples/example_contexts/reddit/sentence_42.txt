TITLE: I received a goldfish that I do not want, what should I do with it?
POST: So this morning I woke up, and there was a note that said "There is a birthday present outside, here is a bucket for it." So I went outside and found that there was a goldfish in a bag filled with water. So I put the bag in the water to get the two waters the same temperature. I then asked my friend who gave it to me the story about it, and long story short, they won a fish at the county fair and gave it to me for my birthday. But since I don't want it, I don't know what to do with it. Any help?
TL;DR:
