TITLE: I [19,F] keep wanting to hurt my best friend [19,M], whom I love.
POST: I've recently fallen in love with my best friend, but he doesn't reciprocate. We've been very close for years and I thought I would be one of the most important people to him, and I know I am, but there are others he has bigger feelings for than me and it makes me want to die. I know it sounds awful, and it IS awful, but I keep wanting to hurt him emotionally--try to prove to myself and him that I'm much more important to him, important enough to cause him as serious a wound as he did to me. 

There's no need to tell me I'm being a bad friend, because I know that, and I've been keeping my distance from him for a while now because of it. The problem is, he wants me back in his life; he keeps saying he misses me, that he still cares about me no matter what. That hurts me in more ways than one: how could he still care about someone who wants to hurt him? I don't feel like I deserve that. And--although this is a part of me I hate--I can't help but ask myself, don't I matter enough to him to scar him? He's forgiven me too fast...too fast even for someone like him. I want to be back in each other's lives too, but I don't have the courage to tell him how much of a terrible person I am. I don't even know how to begin to deal with these feelings. I might need some kind of pep talk.
TL;DR:
