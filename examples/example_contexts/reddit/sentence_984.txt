TITLE: Me [21 F] with my Boyfriend[22 M] of over three years, having problems with balancing boundaries and kink
POST: Early on in our relationship my boyfriend and I had a porn tumblr blog together. We didn't post videos of ourselves (two or three nudes but that's it) but used it more to explore our kinks and look at others together. We are both into BDSM, pet play, but not heavy or 24/7. 

After moving in with family for a few months for financial reasons we dropped the blog because we didn't want any younger relatives to find it on our computer and we just haven't restarted it since.
 

Although we had discussed the difference between doing things together and alone, and laid down cheating guidelines (look but don't touch, not even webcam sex) I recently had to let him know that replying to craigslist personals is cheating in my book. 

He is apologetic and willing to stop/change his habits but I'm worried. We have talked about threesomes before (he is bisexual) but now I am not sure because of the nature of his exchanges with strange women (no men replied to him, not sure if it's from lack of trying or what) I am now very paranoid that he thinks our relationship is open  and/or that he will continue this in secret.

He says he wouldn't have done anything physical without talking to me first but that he does find the idea of sex with a stranger or an occasional hook up arousing. He followed up by saying that he would rather explore these feelings within our relationship either through role playing or fantasizing and will not act on them.

He has since shown me all the emails, deleted them and even agreed to counseling if needed (for himself for this and other issues he has been having). 

Is there anyway to continue being monogamous while still being into pornography and kink or does it open the door too much?
TL;DR:
