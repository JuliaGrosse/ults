TITLE: [22M] How to stay faithful? more importantly should i stick around... [7months]
POST: Forgive me for my shitty grammar reddit-sama.

           My girlfriend[21F] was going through a rough period recently and she wouldnt tell me what was up. So i was worried and anxious for two days wondering what was up. Finally she wanted to talk about it after blaming it on numerous other things and turns out its her father (nothing new but its not a big deal). I just felt.. empty, out of juice. I couldnt even console her. Im normally very understanding and non-jugdemental but something in my mind said "im tired of this shit" and i wanted to break up with her since.

But that's not the biggest issue, i feel like ive been emotionally cheating on her for the past month. Ive been hitting on girls, getting their numbers, and then deleting them essentially. All harmless fun? I feel like my heart is in the wrong place. 

                 This is the only relationship where i haven't cheated and yes im a bastard but im trying here. I constantly check out other girls, and even think about other girls when we are having sex. Is this normal? I feel like im too young to be in a relationship and i dont want to hurt her. I am all she has for support stateside (emotionally not financially) and if i leave her she has basically no-one so i feel as if im abandoning her. I still love this woman and i know in my heart she will be the one that got away. 

                   I just dont know what the right move is because ive never had a good model for a relationship in the first place. Every relationship ive been in resolves the same way but i am admant against cheating on anyone ever again. Is my wandering eye a normal human male thing or am i kidding myself and should i end this? I dont think im built for relationships period but if i were to stay how can i keep my reptilic mind in check and stay focused on the one i love?

Im sorry for being a bastard C.
TL;DR:
