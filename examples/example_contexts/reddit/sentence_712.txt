TITLE: Me [18/m] and my girlfriend [19/f] just broke up, and I can't let go..
POST: We have bin dating for 9 month to the day we broke up, and it has only bin a short while since. I know its never easy to break up but this one just don't feel right.

Well when we was together we always had fun, and a healthy sex life. But then came the 1-2 month before and she slowly started becoming less affected. We close to never kissed passionate anymore and our sex life went down the drain. And every time any thing were to happen  i always had to get it started, and many times without success. This ofc frustrated me, but i thougt to myself that she just needed some time. We later talked about it and she told me she didn't have the same feelings anymore. After while she told me that she didn't want to keep disappointing me by not returning the feelings and love i gave her. With then led to us breaking up. I know i cant force her to feel anything she don't. But is there anything i could do to make her get that feeling back. I love her very much and it just don't feel right giving up on it already. All i want is to get back together with her, she is the only thing that was going good in my life, even when she wasn't affected.

I know there are other fish in the sea, and life goes on, and i'm still young. That's what every body is saying, that's not the advice i need.
