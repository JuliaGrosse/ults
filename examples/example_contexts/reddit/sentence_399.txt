TITLE: what thing have u been scared to death of but turns out to be something else?
POST: I had put a new sim card and the iphone pin in between my iphone case and iphone (i normally do this with my bus ticket), and lyed down in bed and was messaging my friend. I had turned off the lights at this point and the pin had fallen out of the case and landed on my shoulder, because it was totally unexpected and dark, i assumed it was a giant but and grabbed it and threw it across the room. only when it hit the wall and make a metal sound did i realise that it was the pin i had put in earlier. i not seen the pin since
TL;DR:
