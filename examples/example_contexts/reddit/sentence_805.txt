TITLE: Found this document labeled "thoughts"... so Reddit, what do you think?
POST: I always wonder what guys are thinking when you are just starting to 'talk' to one of them. I wonder if they wonder what the future between you two will be like. I wonder if they wonder about a future with another person at all. Do they worry like women do? Do they wonder if they will ever be alone when they're older? Maybe they're just always confident that they will eventually meet someone even if they're older. Men are lucky in that way. They age like fine wine. Women on the other hand seem to expire after a certain age. Women become unwanted after wrinkles creep in, bags under the eyes start to form, your youth fading away.... Maybe this is why women worry so much more about finding someone to spend our life with. Because women want to make sure they have someone that will love them even after time starts to take a toll on their looks. Is this why women have always been expected to marry young? Because of this ultimate truth in the world? Now it's even harder to keep up with looking 'good' because of all the false advertising of how women's bodies should be. There is always the argument brought up that 'looks don't really matter'. Lies. Looks do matter because that's the first thing that attracts you to a person. That attraction is needed on a physical level, to a certain extent, in a relationship. After that you may look for a certain kind of emotional connection with the person. Then start finding out different interests you share, and some you can learn from one another. Also, religion comes into play. Sometimes that can be a deal breaker in a relationship. With so many factors coming into play, how do you find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?
TL;DR:
