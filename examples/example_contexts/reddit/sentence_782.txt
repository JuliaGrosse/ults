TITLE: I invited two girls to the same concert. What do I do?
POST: So I originally invited a girl, I'll call her Amy, to a concert. We had hung out a couple times and I was genuinely interested her. Well last week Amy had to cancel our plans Monday but rescheduled for last Wednesday. Come Wednesday, she said she would be over at 6:30. I waited and waited but Amy never showed up or contacted me. 

I sent her a text message on Thursday and didn't hear back. I didn't bother trying to talking to her Friday, because fuck that. I saw she was posting on instagram and snapchat and it kinda bothered me. 

So I went out drinking with some friends Saturday, and ran into a girl I dated a couple years ago, I'll call her Katie. Turns out Katie and I hit it off well. And since I figured Amy was now old news, I invited Katie to the concert. She said yes. 

Fast forward a couple days and I finally heard back from Amy, she apologized and said she just had a bad week. Amy and I have been texting a little bit again, but not like before. I've also been talking with Katie. Neither have said anything about the concert, it's still a couple weeks away. I'm not sure what to do. Can anybody offer some advice or anything?

I realize I probably jumped the gun with considering Amy old news, but she bailed on me twice and didn't respond to me for several days. I looked like she was simply avoiding me or no longer interested. And alcohol.
TL;DR:
