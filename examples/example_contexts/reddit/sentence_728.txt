TITLE: Me [27 F] with my bf [30 M] of five mths, I thinj he's cheating on me
POST: We met on tinder. I didn't think i would be able to find somebody "proper" on that app and it was more of a joke when i first started it.

I didn't physically meet anyone else other than him from that application and I quickly deleted it after we started our relationship.

I knew he still had it on his phone but i just thought he was too lazy to get rid of it or something.

He said he was going to be gone for work for two weeks. He ignored most of my messages except when i asked him if he was coming back last week to which he said no not for another week.
So another week has passed and i thinj he's in town but he's MIA.

I couldn't help but feel that he had changed and i felt something was off.

I reinstalled tinder and i see that his profile has newly updated photos. Now i know that the application doesn't just automatically update the profile photos and you gotta select them.

So i think he's been cheating on me and he's nowhere to be seen.

This is killing me and i want to do something about it.

I cried to sleep last night and i woke up early this morning because i just couldn't get the thought off my head.

I don't know when i will see him again and i really want to confront him (i can't stand cheaters. He knows it and he had even told me that it's not my fault i met guys like that in the past.)

I know at the latest i will see him by next week. But what should i do in the meanwhile? This is driving me nuts and I'm dying inside.
TL;DR:
