TITLE: Me [33 M] with my wife [32 F] of ten years. She is feeling pressured by my advances. It is creating major problems in our marriage.
POST: My wife and I have been married for ten years and have three children. I love this woman, and for the most part our marriage has been pretty good. Recently, however, I have noticed that she doesn't really have a carnal attraction to me. Most of the time when we have sex I am initiating, the lights are off and it is pretty vanilla.

I have been cursed with a ridiculously high libido. I can masturbate twice in a day and still be ready for sex by bed time. My wife does not match up with this frequency. I would say out of every five times I try and initiate, she will accept one.

The problem is, I seem to have wrapped my entire self worth into our sex life and my feelings get really hurt when she declines my advances. The day following a rejection I am usually distant and grumpy and generally a real prick to be around. This has created tension in our sex life because now when my wife knows I am going to try and initiate she feels extreme pressure and sometimes annoyance because she knows I am going to act like a whiny baby if I don't get sex.

I really don't want to behave this way, but I have invested so much emotion into this that I have started hating myself to the point that I can't even look at myself in the mirror. Typing this out makes me realize how fucked up it is. I really just need advice on finding self worth outside of sex with my wife. I am ruining my marriage and I don't know what to do.
TL;DR:
