TITLE: Need advice on my college path
POST: I have an AA degree and recently transferred to a university. I applied to major in English with a specialization in creative writing and got in but I realized I wanted to major in a STEM degree, more specifically computer science or engineering. The college im at won't let me because I don't have the pre reqs. So now im going to be stuck at an overpriced university doing a non STEM degree which i dont think the money ill be paying is worth it. My long term goals after college is to be able to work from home and start a business. My original plan with the English degree was to write scripts for movies with a friend mine who is finishing his degree in film studies. Like i said before, i don't know if an English degree at this university will be worth it.
TL;DR:
