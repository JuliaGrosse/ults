TITLE: Autopay Accident - How to Best Handle?
POST: Hey all -

Apologies if already posted - on mobile. Have heard good things about yall. Maybe yall can help a newb in need of advice. 

So, I'll jump right to it. I have multiple accounts at the moment. A "bills" account with checks, which is used for bills. A savings (with weekly deposits of $25 - not much but trying to save). And a "fun money" account through simple for spending/short term savings. 

I apparently left an autopay for my car payment turned on in my main bills account and it is posting as we speak. I had already paid the bill manually and didn't get any sort of reminder this autopay was happening until this evening when according to the bank it was "too late to cancel" and it will take them 45-90 days to refund the money. The issue is: rent will be paid this week out of my bills account and I hate to pull so much out of savings to be waiting in limbo to be repaid. Should I a) pull out money from my savings to pay for expenses and bills and keep paying extra on bills due (such as loans and credit cards) or b) reduce payment on my credit cards (from $100 over minimum balance to just minimum) for the next few months and put things as needed on them to be repaid in 45-90 days? Aiming to make the best situation happen in this rock and hard place scenario. Hope this makes some sense. It's late and I'm tired and slightly frustrated at myself. :/
TL;DR:
