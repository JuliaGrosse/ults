TITLE: me [26m] and new friend [23f], just want to be friends, don't want to lead her on. what should i do/say?
POST: I am currently going through a separation with my gf of 5 years. We are both unsure of things, but have talked here and there and there is a possibility of us getting back together. This was a mutual split and the story behind this is much too long and somewhat unrelated.

Now, 4 or so weeks after my ex and I separated, I met someone else - Jen. Jen and I have hung out a few times, but I consider her only a friend. We have similar senses of humor. We talked for awhile and I asked if she wanted to hang out sometime- she said yes. We haven't done anything fancy, just watch tv and whatnot. I mostly just need friends which is why I approached her in the first place. I'm getting the impression that she thinks I am looking to be more than friends despite the fact we haven't been physical and I don't say flirtatious comments to her. I hate to have to tell this girl that I am not looking for someone like that because MAYBE she isn't either, which might be awkward.

Any suggestions? I like hanging out with her, but there isn't attraction (at least on my end). What can I say to her to just make sure that, before we continue hanging out, she knows my intentions?
TL;DR:
