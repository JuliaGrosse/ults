TITLE: Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [19 F] 6 months, moving in with male roommate
POST: Redditors,

At the beginning of the relationship, my girlfriend applied for a job that would provide free housing this year while she is at college (I work in a city 3 hours away). She did not receive the position, so she found a roommate: a male roommate who is someone she went to high school with.  Since we had just started dating, I didn't really have a lot of grounds to tell her she couldn't, but she did ask me (and was incredibly nervous) prior to making a decision. 

Now, as school is about to begin, I find myself worrying to death over the situation. She and I love each other very much; however, my concern is that issues will arise since we are 3 hours apart. She reassures me that there is nothing to worry about, but I can't help it. 

What should I do? What should I ask her about the situation, and how can I lessen the chances of anything happening? I can see myself marrying this woman beyond a shadow of a doubt, and it would break my heart if something were to happen due to the roommate situation.
TL;DR:
