TITLE: 2 of my friends were dating, one cheated and they broke up.  I'm having a rough time with it.
POST: Here's the story (we're 21/22 year old females): My friend ("C") since preschool started dating a girl ("S") that we knew from girl scout camp. S had been dating a guy, broke up with him, and they started dating on the down low about 2 years ago.  I found out after the summer had ended and was shocked, but got over it.  The three of us were good friends, but I'm obviously closer to C, who I've known most of my life.  

C and S were working together at the same camp this summer, I didn't come back this year because I had an internship.  A few weeks into the summer (they've been dating for almost 2 years at this point), S says she's kind of into this other counselor and just needs some time ALONE to think about their relationship, etc.  So they go on a "brea."  C is crushed, but goes with it.  They get a weekend off, and S comes back with hickies all over her, and it comes out that she's been hooking up with this other girl.  

So I hear about all this and it just hits me really hard.  I'm shocked at first because I can't believe S would do something like that, then freakin pissed at S for hurting C so terribly.  I almost called S and cussed her out, but stopped myself.  I visited camp for a night the day after I found out.  I got the whole story from C, and S had the balls to come up and say hello to me like nothing was wrong.  I was relatively friendly considering the situation, but underneath I was still pretty livid.  

As some time passed, I was less angry and more sad because I had lost a good friend in S and never really got a chance to hear her side of the story.  But now I don't feel like I can talk to her without betraying C.

So I'm really at a loss of what to do.
TL;DR:
