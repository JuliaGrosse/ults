SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [22M] with my gf [23F] 8 months together, I am most likely leaving for graduate school. My gf thinks this will break us, what do i do?
POST: So this is my story:
I have been seeing my current gf for around 1.5 years now. When we met i had already planned to go to Australia, however we kept in touch and when i came back  when got a relationship.

We had this relationship for 6 months, when she decided to go to Australia (for 5 months).  It has been going well for quite some time now, but we've started discussing what we plan on doing after she comes back.

She has one more year in her current college and i will be finished this year. I am planning on working for a year or moving to a different city for graduate school. I told her about this and she reacted very strangely. Distance has never been a real issue, but now she is saying that she feel unsure and that the distance would be difficult because she will be busy (the distance will be approx. 2h by train).

She said that she would support me if i would go, but that she felt that we would grow apart if we would do this. Now I'm really stressing about this.
Furthermore she just added that she will most likely go to a different city for her graduate school. Which means that one way or another this distance will happen.

I am stressing. Should i just break up to avoid all this stress?
TL;DR:
