TITLE: Me [20's F] with my father [60's M]: I'm scared he may be an alcoholic and I don't know what to do.
POST: I think my father may be an alcoholic, but I was hoping someone who may have experience or some knowledge about it can help me out and help me figure out what to do.

My dad has a steady job and has never had drinks at work/ work functions.  However, recently I noticed that his beer intake has grown.  He drinks about six to eight 16oz (about 96-120 oz total)  cans after he gets home from work.  He's not verbally abusive/physically abusive, but he does get hard to understand and I worry because I feel like I have to take care of him and make sure he doesn't do anything stupid like fall over/ trip and fall when he's cleaning. 

The reason I'm writing this mostly is because today he drank an entire bottle of wine by himself along with 4 16oz beers, and he already asked my brother to go get him another 4 pack.  

He used to drink a lot about 10 years ago, but he stopped and then started again in the past 4-5 years.  His intake has grown tremendously, from two 8oz cans a day to now what I've described.

I have anxiety, especially when it comes to things like this so I don't know what to do. If I bring it up he will get upset, but I don't know what else to do? Is he an alcoholic? Am I overreacting? Please help. I don't know what to do.
TL;DR:
