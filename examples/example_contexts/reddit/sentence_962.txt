TITLE: TIFU by making fun of a teacher's salary
POST: I am an exchange student in the United States and my academic year here is approaching its end. I am enrolled in an IB Calculus class although I am not testing in IB (it's the only Calculus class). We took our class final and everyone is spending their time in that class just solving IB practice tests. I, however, decided to catch up on the maths lessons I have missed during the year so I can go back ready to my country.

The statistics teacher next door has a free period during our class so she usually walks in and sits down with the calculus teacher. The syllabus I am working with does include a few statistics lesson but I needed a general idea of what actually I should be focusing on. I decided to ask the statistics teacher just for a bit of guidance since it's her free period.

I walk up to the teacher's desk and I explain my situation to them. The calculus teacher tells me to "just google it" but I told her I'd rather get guidance from a real teacher. She said she knows that but the statistics teacher is on her free period now and doesn't work during that time.

I was about to leave the desk, I was not happy with their reaction but I completely understood where they were coming from. The statistics teacher noticed that I'm displeased and jokingly said "Unless you pay me how much a teacher earns per hour!" I was furious at that remark and I was well aware that teachers do not earn a lot of money as they always complained about it. I replied "I'm sure that's not very much." She just stares at me in the eye and she starts shouting about how disrespectful that was.

I was extremely embarrassed, I have rarely ever disrespected a teacher my whole life. I quickly apologized and went back to my seat but she kept complaining about how disrespectful that is. I may screwed up my good reputation among teachers a week before school ends.
TL;DR:
