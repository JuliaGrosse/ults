TITLE: Getting threatening messages from Ebay buyer, help?
POST: My dad sold a Kindle Cover for roughly 15 bucks a while ago. It was the old, slightly defected one that sometimes causes the Kindle to turn off/lose battery. In his description, he copied some description of the item of some other site and the description turned out to be that of the new Kindle cover. So this guy buys it, sends it to his friend in Russia. Guy in Russia finds out that it's the old cover, starts complaining about how the item description is false (ok, our fault) and he wants a full compensation for the item and the shipping it cost him to send it to Russia, along with all the fees and refuses to ship the cover back, instead sending images proving that he destroyed it. He finds out we are Russian-speakers as well, starts sending us non-stop emails to our private emails. After some reluctance(we used the cover, it's definitely usable), my dad pays refunds the item. Apparently, my dad missed $1.04 in some extra fees. THIS TIME HE FINDS OUR PRIVATE HOME NUMBER AND CALLS US DIRECTLY. We did not give him our number or any permission to contact us through that number. So my dad pays him the $1.04, but PayPal took off 30 cents, and the guy only got 80 cents. This is the GOOD PART: He sends us an email threatening to send messages describing our "wrong-doings" to ALL OUR FACEBOOK FRIENDS AND REAL LIFE NEIGHBORS. What should we do?
TL;DR:
