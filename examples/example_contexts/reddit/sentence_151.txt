TITLE: It's Mother's Day, and the emotions have finally hit me (24F) because the mother's I could celebrate have already passed on
POST: This is more of a venting of sad emotions b/c I have another 2 1/2 at work, than looking for advice. Consolation, maybe. Also, this is a major struggle for me to write now.

I've spent a fair portion of my day checking Facebook on and off, which is naturally covered in Happy Mother's Day things (I even posted one of my own in memory). I also went out to brunch with my boyfriend and saw plenty of happy families enjoying todays specials at XYZ restaurant, as well as at work. But it's finally hit me, and I can't take too much more of it, because I don't have a mother to call up and praise or thank in a way that I know would be understood. (I'm also 5hrs away from where I grew up/where she's buried so leaving flowers on her headstone isn't really an option.)
 
My mom died 2 weeks after my 20th birthday. It will have been 4yrs ago in a couple of days, and my grandmother only 16 months and 3 days after her. I was close to them both and I miss them so much every day. I wish I could call them, catch them up on my life, introduce them to my boyfriend, get their opinion on the state of my career just to hear their support, cry to them about stupid work issues, anything and everything. 

Fewer things make me angrier than when I hear someone bad mouthing their mom (when its not an abusive relationship, mind you) because somethings not going their way, or Mom's not reacting to something in the way they were expecting and are losing their cool. I'm angry at them because I'm jealous of what they still have that I lost- each other's company- and I so desperately wish I could have just one more conversation with her, that their snipping is showing how much they undervalue just that much.
TL;DR:
