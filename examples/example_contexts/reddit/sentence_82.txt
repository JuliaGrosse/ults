TITLE: I [25M] am dating [25f], unsure if she wants something serious or casual; how to find out?
POST: I have been dating this girl for a few weeks so far, but I'm not entirely sure where it is going. I think we work well together, and I am honestly fine whether she wants something serious or casual. Slight preference to something more serious since we match up so well though.

However, I can't really figure out what she wants. We haven't had sex yet, we have only kissed. Which I am fine with, I have not tried anything, since I want to do it 'right' and she also seems to be a bit apprehensive about it since she doesn't want us to move too fast. At least, that's the vibe I am getting. So that makes me think she's looking for something serious.

However, some other things make me thing she wants to keep it casual. She every time says that we are just hanging out, she invites me to a bunch of things with her friends (guess you can see this as both a good thing and a bad thing) instead of trying to make one-on-one time. We still hang out just the two of us, though. She also says it takes a long time to actually like someone and hasn't been in a serious relationship for two years.

I thought about asking her flat out "So where do you think this is going?" but I'm not sure if I want to do that so early on. I just mostly want to know if I should start opening my heart, or keep it shut. So how would I go about that? How do I find out what she wants/what do you guys think her angle is?
TL;DR:
