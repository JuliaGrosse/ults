TITLE: I think I was just lied to, need some advice on where to go next.
POST: The girl I've been seeing for the past week just let another guy answer the phone and say that he was her brother. He told me that she was having a rough day and not really in the mood to talk and that she would call me tomorrow. We have talked extensively about my brother, because we don't get along and yet she has never mentioned her brother. I'm not really upset that another guy has answered her phone; I am more upset that I believe he lied about being her brother. What is the best way to approach this situation to foind out if she's actually lying to me or if (s)he was telling the truth. I want to avoid looking like a jealous asshole because jealousy really isnt my problem here. My problem is the possibility of the lie. She knows how much I hate being lied to and yet this does not sit right with me. I should also mentioned that she is 18 and I am 28, so there is a little bit of an age gap here. The issue might be caused by immaturity... I'm just looking for a good way to bring it up and find out the truth without seeming like a jealous douchebag because like I said, I don't care who the guy is or what they were doing together... but don't lie to me.
TL;DR:
