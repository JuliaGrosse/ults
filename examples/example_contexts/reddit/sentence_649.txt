TITLE: Just broke up with my [20F] boyfriend [21M] of three and a half years, I'm lonely and heartbroken. Help?
POST: We were together for three and a half years. Our personalities are both very head-strong and it was the first very serious relationship that each of us had so we lacked communication and argued to the point where it was unhealthy. 

Despite all of that, we were each other's best friends. We had so much in common and traveled and made so much memories together. We grew up together and were by each other's sides through the trials and tribulations. We didn't have friends in common because we hung out with different groups of people therefore we spent a ton of time together. I would even say we were codependent on each other. We both drifted apart from our friends until the point where it would just be us two. Maybe we lasted longer than we did because we were both scared of being lonely.

We both agreed that while our love was something very special, it was also extremely unhealthy. I have no ill will towards him and his love was something that was inspiring yet humbling. Wherever life takes me in the future, I will forever blessed to have experienced a love like this. Our relationship just got to the point where it became just a very toxic environment to be apart of.

Now that we're no longer together, it is very lonely. I have so much free time now and so much emptiness that I don't know how to fulfill it with. There are times where I'll hear a song or run across something that we used to do together and I'll feel a pit in my stomach. It's been a month and it hasn't gotten easier. 

I don't have many friends. However, I'm moving out of state in six months (another big reason why we broke up) so that is something to look forward to. I'm not in college but will be attending a trade school of sorts. It's just the time between now and then that is so crippling for me to think of. What can I do to get rid of this pain?
TL;DR:
