TITLE: Being forced to be Catholic...what to do?
POST: About two or three months ago, my mom divorced my dad and he moved out.  The relationship had been bad for many years, so no suprise there (sadness, but no suprise).  A coupla weeks later, her boyfriend, who she had been "just friends" with when she was still married to my dad, moved in.

He is a devout Catholic, has been going to Mass every day for fortysomething years.  Ever since he moved in, she's been going with him.  Now, I have school, so I can't go every day, but she still insists that I go every weekend and go through all the rituals and shit, including getting a blessing from the priest EVERY SINGLE TIME.  In addition to that, she signs me up for all kinds of Catholic clubs and activities without asking me, to the point I'm spending much more time at the parish than desirable.

Normally, I'm a go-along-to-get-along guy, but this is beginning to get on my nerves.  I'm not really sure I'm an atheist, but I've never really bought this whole Christianity thing either, I've just pretended to believe in it to keep my parents from coming down on my like a shit-ton of bricks.

So reddit, should I tell her I'm sick of this shit?  Or should I keep putting up with it until I can move out?
TL;DR:
