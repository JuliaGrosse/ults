TITLE: How do I prevent "The one that got away" from happening?
POST: I met this guy a few years back. We were amazing for eachother. We accomplished so much and made eachother so happy. However, it was our lousy communication and our nervous/awkwardness that ruined things. He quietly thought to himself that I was using him as a rebound after the ex I left him for. I thought he still had a crush on his crush of 5 years. So, we were always in "self protect" mode from a few weeks into our relationship. However, it didn't start that way. He came out with so many beautiful long term things in the first few days like a happy kid at Christmas. I completely felt the same way. Then our awful minds got the worst of us and we never communicated. So, after a few months, we broke up after me being confused over his old crush after I met her. However, after the break up, we hung out more than ever and he'd look for reasons to see me, come over my place, or go out somewhere. I cuddled him one of those times and he got all nervous like it was the beginning of us again. However, he moved 1000 miles away...oddly at the same time I got a job offer to move nearby. We're the same out here. I'll crash with him and he'll push for me to sleep in his arms if I can't sleep and he'll help me anytime I ask, etc. I started dating somebody else to try to move on and I'm still with him...for a year now. And, I'm always in self protect mode around the first guy saying I've moved on but he knows I'm not truly happy. The first guy is career focused and doesn't know where he'll land after finishing his second degree here. So, he's scared of a relationship holding him back. How do I convince him he's the one for me and I'd never stop his career.
TL;DR:
