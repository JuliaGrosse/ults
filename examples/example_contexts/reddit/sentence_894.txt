TITLE: I [22M] just came back home to my [23F] gf of 5 years after visiting family for a and she has moved another guy into our room. My roomates are supporting it.
POST: I live in California, and went to visit my family for a month after not seeing them for years and my girlfriend stayed behind at our shared apartment. We had been going through a rough patch and had talked about a break shortly before I left to come back to my apartment, but had made plans for things to do together and how to get back on the right track when I returned. I never heard any different until I walked into my apartment and she told me she was with someone else and he was staying there some. Last night my first night back I went to go sleep after this news and the drive and he was in my room, my now ex told me that I have to go somewhere else even though I've paid my portion of the rent, and my friends/room mates have been apologetic to me, but supported it because "its what she wants" and because he had apparently paid rent as well. I arrived late and was hit by these bombshells and now I don't know where to go or what to do. The whole life I had built seems gone, and she is showing no sign of remorse. She also led me along to send her money while I was away and set it up for us to attend a festival, which included tickets and renting a car.

We've always seemed good together and I'm completely blindsighted that she could even do something like this. Any advice on how to deal with the situation, get my room back. Find another place to stay or just not have a mental brakedown would be appreciated.
