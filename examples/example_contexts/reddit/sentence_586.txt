SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My (22F) ex (23M) messaged me after 6 months of no contact. Is it dumb if I were to message back? Advice/opinions would be appreciated!
POST: After my ex and I started NC, I really took the time and dedicated it to improving myself. In that regard, I did pretty well. I've confronted (and conquered!) some personal fears and baggage, picked up new hobbies that I love, met new people and created amazing friendships. I'm happy, and I know that I have a bright future ahead of me.

When my ex messaged me yesterday telling me he wants to talk to me and misses me, I realized I didn't really feel anything towards it. I didn't feel like I 'won' or had power over him. I'm honestly just exasperated. I think he only misses me because he's lonely. He spent the past 6 months drinking, partying, and hooking up with a ton of girls. And he probably feels guilty about how we last ended things. Basically I don't think he's trying to initiate a conversation with me for the right reasons. 

I want to talk to him because I kind of pity him. I feel sorry that he's not in a great place right now, and I want to help him. On some level, I do miss him, just not romantically. I miss talking to him as a friend. But at the same time, I don't want to risk getting hurt again. I have ZERO desire to get back together with him. I know I can do better than how he was treating me. And he has a lot of personal shit to work out before he's ready for a relationship anyway. I guess I'm just afraid the old feelings I had for him might somehow creep up again. 

Should I stick with NC? Or should I respond to him?
TL;DR:
