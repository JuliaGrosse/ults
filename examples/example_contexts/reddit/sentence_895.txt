TITLE: Anyone coming to Martha's Vineyard from the Southern CT area in the next week?
POST: I have a package that was supposed to be delivered today, that I intended on bringing when we came to the vineyard. The problem is that we left for the Vineyard a few hours before it arrived (we had to make the ferry). 
I can arrange for a family member to retrieve the package, but I would need someone to bring the package to the Vineyard.
It would be great if someone could help, but it is nothing that someone would have to go out of their way for. 
The package is a few knick nacks I bought and you can play a game with them, B-Daman, if you have heard of them. I ordered them a few weeks ago and have been waiting awhile.
TL;DR:
