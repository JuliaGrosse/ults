TITLE: My girlfriends (26F) cousin (24F) works with me and we carpool. The cousin comes to my house, sits on my bed, and wait for her boyfriend to pick her up. It's driving my girlfriend crazy. Am I in the wrong?
POST: Recently my girlfriends cousin got hired at my work place. The cousin doesn't have a car yet, so she carpools with me. After work, the cousin has to come stay at my house for a few minutes because her boyfriend has to go pick up their daughter first. The cousin comes to my room and sits on my bed while she waits.  

When my girlfriend found out that she stays in my room, she got really mad. In fact, I just had an argument with her about it. Basically, my girlfriend says it's really weird and unlady-like for her cousin to do that and it's even weirder for me to let her. But I never even thought of it that way. I absolutely love my girlfriend to death and she's all I ever think about. I don't even look at other women anymore because I'm still crazy for her. And I would never cheat on her or do anything close to might be considered cheating. I am in no way attracted to her cousin at all.

I just don't see anything wrong with it because I'm not insecure about my feelings and don't care to judge others much. But my girlfriend is basically saying, "Well what am I supposed to think when we have kids and you condone this type of behavior???" Even though I never said I condone it.

I just don't know what to think right now. Am I the asshole in this situation?
