TITLE: What can I [20/M] do to make my date [22/M] know that I'm romantically interested?
POST: Recently had a first date with a guy, and I had a really good time. It was a lot of fun, however for me at time it sort of felt like a job interview. A little friendly but distant and really sterile platonic topics. I'm interested in asking for a 2nd date some time in the future.

In the event that happens, or for any future scenario, what can I do to let my date eventually know I'm interested in them in a safe appropriate way? 

I've never been a touchy physical person, all of my friendships and family relationships are pretty hands-off in terms of physical contact. So no matter what I'm feeling, hand holding or playful touching is something that I find hard to initiate. Not to mention gauging the comfort level of the other person. 

Another wrinkle is that I'm gay and I don't always feel safe being physical with my dates in public since I don't always know if the environment will be 100% friendly towards me in that sense.
TL;DR:
