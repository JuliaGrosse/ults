TITLE: Need advice on an ex girlfriend and how to approach it.
POST: My girlfriend had broken up with me. Things didn't work out. It's been a few months and I still see her fairly often. I pick her up from whereever, sleep at her house all the time etc. However she doesn't want to pick up the pieces and continue forth as she isn't ready, which is fair. School started and I'm scared we will drift apart, that my role in her life would become merely a fond memory of the past. I cant seem to move on myself. I tried many times. Ended up sleeping with multiple women but I cant shake the thoughts of her. She was perfect for me. We work so well together. How can I get her to sway back to me in the ways I had before?
TL;DR:
