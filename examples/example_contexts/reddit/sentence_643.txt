TITLE: I [20M] have a crush on this girl [20F] and asked her to study together but got rejected. What should I do now?
POST: I met this girl this Tuesday night at a science museum (we went to a planetarium show there for some extra credits for our astronomy class). We sat together during the show but didn't get the chance to talk to each other (quiet place, had to focus on the show).

    After the show we took the subway together and had some little talk on our way back to school and exchanged our numbers. The next day (Wed.) I asked her after the class if she wanna study for the midterm with me on Thursday night (midterm's on Friday). She said she was not sure and would let me know. But I didn't hear her back so just text her this afternoon and after a couple of hours she said she wouldn't be able to study with me tonight. 

    So am I going a bit fast? To be honest I like this girl and really wanna spend some time with her; but I got rejected. What should I do now if I don't wanna just move on? The girl is beautiful and so cute, a very good girl! Help me guys I don't have too much experience on this kinda stuff. Technically this was the first time I asked a girl out (and just for studying...) in my college life (sophomore year now) so you see I really do like her. Any idea would be appreciated!
TL;DR:
