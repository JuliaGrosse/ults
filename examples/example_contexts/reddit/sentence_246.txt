SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I (41F) don't have the energy to break up with my boyfriend (40m).
POST: He is currently at RIDOC (please don't judge) but I did not meet him there. There was so much familiarity in all of this and comfort. His mom died not too long ago so he really has nowhere to live when he gets out. Most of all our dating and romance has in fact been done throughout his prison sentence(s) (he got out and then quickly went back in bc his mom died and he was drinking a lot etc).

In some ways my life has gotten better. I went back to work. I'm so afraid of so many things though. I don't really have the energy for a live in boyfriend especially knowing or always thinking he is there bc he has nowhere else. He has assured me he is not many times but I'm not comfortable with all this pressure. I keep thinking maybe he can do better and I don't want to wait until that happens. I'm tired of feeling lousy about myself. He has some narcissistic tendencies. Even his mom said sometimes he can be so sweet and other times he can be the devil. So it's a lot to deal with. 

I couldn't really function that well at work on Saturday. I was so stressed out about going through this break up that I keep prolonging it. I don't know how to get out. I've broken up with him before only to miss him terribly and then chase him again. In fact I can take accountability that I chased him from the beginning. I'm very attracted to him and he is a mechanic too. That's how we met I put an ad on craigslist bc my heater core in my cadillac was broken.

What should I do? Is there any way to ease into it so that it's not so overwhelming? Should I give it a chance? I know no one can really tell me what to do but I can't keep posting on PTO either and I could use some advice.
TL;DR:
