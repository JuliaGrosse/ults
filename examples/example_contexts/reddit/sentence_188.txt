SUBREDDIT: r/Advice
TITLE: I'm being blamed for something I 100% didn't even do..
POST: Okay, to start I am a 19y/o female who works 9-5 M-F. I was recently informed by my boyfriend that someone unlocked their garage door and home early Monday morning. BUT here is where it gets weird. My boyfriends parent's next door neighbor (who is a little girl, around like 10y/o) comes over and hangs out all the time at the house and garage. They suspected she got a hold of the code (its not like a regular key unlock, its a pass code setup) and got into the house and garage, but never locked it after. When they confronted her about it she blamed it on me and said I was the one at the house that day.. But as I stated above, I work Monday to Friday, 9-5. I was definitely not at the house that day because I work in town which is about 30 minutes away.. 
His parents confronted me about it and I told them the truth and that I was not anywhere near the house that day nor do I know the pass code to unlock the doors. The only reason I'm asking for advice though is because his parents went back to the little girl, to see if she would own up to it and she blamed it on me again?! I am truthfully upset and kind of angry she would blame it on me, but what should I do? It also kind of upset me that his parents would even think to accuse me.
TL;DR:
