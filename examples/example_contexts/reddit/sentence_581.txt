TITLE: 22/m and drinking with my 21/f SO
POST: OK so we've been dating for about 2 years but ever since about 6 months in I've noticed any time she drinks she gets unreasonably mad at me. She tells me to leave get away from her and has even insulted me.  And I don't do anything to trigger it. For example her birthday party. We had a bunch of her friends over and we're all on the couch drinking and hanging out when she gets up goes to the hall and starts crying. I go to ask what's wrong and she tells me to get away from her. No explanation has been given for that. There have been about 4 other instances but the latest happened at a party we threw about a month ago. I was outside with my friends and she was inside with her friends when I heard that someone was throwing up and needed help. I immediately left my friends to go find the person and found my SO helping her best friend. I saw they were trying to move her to the bathroom so I tried to pick her up and my SO said just go to which I responded I'm trying to help. She said like you have been all night just fuck off. So I left. I  don't want to be treated like shit when I'm trying to help. She always apologizes but I'm frustrated and don't know if there is an underlying issue.
TL;DR:
