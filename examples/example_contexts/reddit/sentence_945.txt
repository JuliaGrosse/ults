TITLE: Me [17 M] with my girlfriend [17 F] of a year, she isn't talking to me because I got drunk last night by myself.
POST: Last night, I was bored and alone in my room, so I decided to grab a bottle of wine from my parents wine cabinet and have some to drink. Now, I've had alcohol before and I've been drunk on one occasion previous to this. I drank the entire bottle, and was quite drunk afterwards. My girlfriend wanted to talk on the phone, so I called her and we were having a normal conversation. Well, it was pretty obvious how drunk I was, and when she found out the extent of my drunkeness she hung up on me. 

I texted her apologizing, saying that I shouldn't have been drinking at all(which is true, I should not have even touched the bottle), and when I said something along the lines of "baby I'm so sorry, I didn't know you felt that strong about alcohol", she told me to not call her baby, and she said goodbye. This really hurts, I loved her. She was an amazing girlfriend, and what confuses me is that we always talk about sneaking out and having a bottle of wine together. I thought she wouldn't care if I had a bottle to myself. I'm pretty sure she's upset because of how drunk I was, not because I drank with out her.

I tried texting her today but she hasn't replied
TL;DR:
