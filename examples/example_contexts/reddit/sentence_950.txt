SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: The last guy I was in love with [24/M] called me up tonight and left a blank voicemail. I'm [22/F], what do I do?
POST: I'll try to summarize our relationship as simply as possible. We dated somewhat casually for three months before real feelings started to develop, and when they did he was really quick to pull away because he didn't want to get into anything serious. We were then on again off again for the next 4 months, until he decided to end it with me once and for all, stating that he wasn't ready for full blown love and commitment. I know what you're thinking, that he's a commitophobe but he isn't because he had gotten out of a 5 year relationship just two years before I met him.

Anyway, I get a missed call tonight from him and a blank 10 second voicemail, no follow up text. Normally I'd just assume pocket dial (my name starts with A so it happens sometimes). But here's why it's making my heart pump with hope:

* It's January first. The hopeless romantic in me wants to believe he thought he would wait until the new year, and if there was anything left he'd reach out.

* Only two days ago, I removed him from my facebook chat block, so he can again see when I'm online again. Maybe he interpreted this as my first move?

* Three weeks after we broke up, I texted him saying happy birthday. He responded saying that he didn't know who my number was because he got a new phone. Him calling me again is a sign that he had saved my number.

I know I'm crazy and that this is probably nothing. But love makes you crazy sometimes, doesn't it. I've really tried hard to move on from him, I haven't even once contacted him or even LOOKED at his facebook profile, but I've had no success, I still have intense feelings for him. Do I owe it to myself to find out for sure, or am I just bound for more heartbreak? I calmed myself down with a hot shower, and thought I'd let reddit help me out on this one.
TL;DR:
