TITLE: A distant family friend [22M] recently casually asked for my [21F] number, and sent me a text a month later - what does it mean?
POST: This is a family friend I've previously barely ever talked to (not in a mean way, just in a 'we hang out with other people' way). Thus it made me do a double take when he very casually after saying hi at one of these gatherings said, 'Oh, I don't think I have your number, do I?'. I gave him my number, because it would have been rude not to.

1 month later, I get the text, 'Hey Apple_crumble1, this is [insert name] how have you been? Haven't seen you in a while :)'

Now this is a little odd, because we barely ever see each other anyway, not like this is unusual.

I sent a reply along the lines of 'Not bad, studying for exams mainly. You?', and a few minutes later there was a response like '[blah blah, talking about exams] Do your parents let you go out much, like Friday, Saturday nights, or are they very strict?'

Is this a prelude to asking me out, or am I reading too much into idle conversation? I don't have much experience with this kind of thing.

For the record, I'm not interested in him in that way in the slightest. If it is a prelude to a date, any advice on how to prevent such a request/let him down gently without directly saying 'I'm not interested'?
TL;DR:
