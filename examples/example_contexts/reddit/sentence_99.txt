TITLE: BF always jokes that I'm not good enough.
POST: F 23. M 24. 2 Years.

My BF is always making comments and hints about my weight and hair and then posing them off as jokes. He constantly hints that I need to loose a little bit of weight. Perhaps 10 ibs. This is fine b/c I've always thought I've been a little chubby. 

But not my hair. I love my short hair but he really wants me to grow it out or get hair extensions. He's always joking around about how beautiful girls are with long hair. 

On New Years Eve, we went out and this girl who had short hair, got extensions and he joked around that I should too.

I don't want to be coerced into doing something I don't want to do. I really love him and vice versa. He's been such a positive influence in my life except for this. I'd hate to change for him, but I also want to be attractive to him. I'm kind of at a loss here. 

Should I just grow my hair out? Lose the weight?

Oh and problem number 2: I think he likes that girl that got extensions. He's always comparing me to her in a joking manner. At times it does hurt. Other times, I think I'm just being a pussy for letting it get to me. 

Should I just ignore all of this? Am I overreacting?
TL;DR:
