TITLE: Me [17 M] with my (ex?)girlfriend [17 F] 2.5-5 months, cheating or sexual harassment?
POST: I'll be short about this.

A few days ago my girlfriend called me and said she did something and that I'll want to break up with her but she couldn't tell me over the phone and had to text it to me (she sounded like she was about to cry)  We are in a long distance relationship since about 2-3 weeks ago.

She then texts me that she "slipped" and had done something sexual with another man.  I'll be honest our relationship was already not very healthy so it didn't really come to me as a surprise.

Naturally, I break up with her.  She doesn't want to accept that we are broken up.  She calls me and keeps asking for a second chance saying that she regrets it and it was a mistake.  I am adamant about staying broken up though she is crying and refusing it.

A few hours later she texts me that it was out of her control.  I ask how that's possible if she gave consent and she says she didn't.  So the situation is now very complicated.  

After hearing this I sort of "un-broke up" with her and instead switched to a "break".  This is kinda arbitrary but whatever.  Anyway I just don't know what to do now.  I don't know what to believe.  Even if she is now telling the complete truth I don't think I would want to go back to a relationship though I would feel a sort of responsibility to.

I don't know if I gave enough here for you to form an opinion but you may as well try.  You can go and look at my last post if you want more information.  You'll probably call me an idiot for not breaking up earlier honestly but that's ok.
TL;DR:
