TITLE: I [f23] don't want to go on a second date with [m24]. He is angry and thinks I'm shallow
POST: A month ago I met a 24M on Okcupid. We liked each others pictures and hit it off, and so went on the date.

The date was... Cringeworthy. First off he was 5'5 at most instead of 5'9 like he said he was. I'm a 5'7 female, not a freakishly tall woman ny any means, but I do look for a man who is at least my hight or taller. I don't think that's unreasonable. I mean, I'm slightly overweight and I don't expect great abs or CQ model looks. But I won't date shorter than me.

The guy, lets call him Josh, made me uncomfortable throughout the entire date. He made sexual comments, asked me about my sexual past etc. He played a cheesy song, wrote a crappy poem for me at the restaurant and said he loved me...

I was really annoyed with him. When the bill came I planned on splitting it, but he had forgotten his wallet and I ended up paying. He asked me for another date but I told him we weren't compatible and thanked him for the evening. He seemed okay, but then he started texting me, asking if it was because of his height. I told him it wasn't. He sent me an angry message about how I am only a a 6\10 and that women only want 6'5 guys and that he had to lie on dating sites.

Honestly yes, his height is a turn off but his behavior is more so. He now texts me about once a day and tries to convince me to 'be friends'. I don't want anything to do with him. What can I do?
TL;DR:
