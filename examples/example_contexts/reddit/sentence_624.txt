SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I've been [22F] with my girlfriend [24F] for a year, she's an extrovert, I'm an introvert, how to proceed?
POST: Thus far, things have been very good, but throughout our relationship she was cutting a lot of old friends that didn't treat her the best, so now she doesn't have anyone to hang out with.

Over time that's wore on her, I can't tell she's much more unhappy, and while she's looking for new friends right now, I started to wonder, for anyone with some experience here- is it better to force myself to go out more? Or is it better to let her go out mostly by herself to get that part of life that she needs? (My only fear there is that it could distance us too much, but I would enjoy that solitude once in a while)

What's a girl to do?
TL;DR:
