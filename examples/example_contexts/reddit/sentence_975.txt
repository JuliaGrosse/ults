TITLE: Me [25 M] with my wife [23 F] of 5 years, she sent pics
POST: So she sent nude pics to a friend of hers that she has a history with that always tries to sexualize things. To my knowledge she never as done anything like this before though and has been honest about his advances. 

She told me what happened and is claiming she doesn't even really remember it. She does have black outs and deals with a lot of mental problems. But she was honest, told me that he claimed she did it, and when she got evidence she was honest with me.

We have been through A LOT and I have always been very forgiving. I've had stuff thrown at me, I've been belittled, and in some sense now betrayed. Usually I let things go pretty fast because I knew she had issues going into this marriage...but this one has me so f-ing mad. I've blown up on her a few times since she told me and I'm being snappy at work. 

I want things to work because we have kids. I don't have the means to put them into daycare either. And oh yeah...regardless of everything I love her unconditionally....but when is enough enough? 

I don't know what to do. I love her and don't want her to leave. If I do ask her to leave she has no where to go but her Dad's which is the definition of a shit hole. I'm worried too if I do end things she is at a risk to kill herself or at least sink to a point where it isn't good to have her around the kids. She has worked so hard to be a good person despite having such a rough childhood. She is willing to work on things, and said she'll live with any consequences. 

Ugh wtf Reddit. What should I do?
