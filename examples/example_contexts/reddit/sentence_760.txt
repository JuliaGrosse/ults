SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice
TITLE: My girlfriend [27F] is much too helpful, or am I [23M] just being greedy with her time?
POST: I've recently made it official with her after a few months of dating. She has friends all the way back from high school that are a part of her life. Guys and girls alike.

But there's this one dude that irks me.

They don't spend casual time together like eating lunch or anything. He's... a bit inept. She drives him out of town so he can buy video games, or takes him to the dentist. Stuff like that, a pro-bono social worker.

But it's every fucking week. I couldn't see her *this week* because she's spread so thin as it is.

I've known her for 3+ years now. But we still need to figure who we are together.

*He isn't unable, if you will, I think the putz just got used to her caring for him.*

Did I mention we're all in our mid to late 20's? What the hell, man. Get a car, or your fucking parents.

It isn't festering in me just yet. When something bothers me I can feel my face get warm and I clench my teeth. It hasn't got to that point, but I don't want it to get passive-aggressive with her, and then aggressive-aggressive.

She told he's recently learned to tie his shoes. *What the fuck is this*?
TL;DR:
