TITLE: How many Americans would have to refuse to pay taxes to effectively protest military action in Syria?
POST: Between the government's hypocritical treatment of whistleblowers, intrusive domestic surveillance, failures of oversight, various fiascoes in the Department of Justice (ineffective "War on Drugs" prosecutions, botching of Project Gunrunner with the ATF, aggressive targeting of journalists, etc), one of the most unproductive Congresses in decades, and the usual partisan infighting, grandstanding and military-cooperate masturbation, I no longer feel any sense of representation, affiliation, or allegiance to the Federal government. Military action in Syria on shaky-at-best grounds is the last straw for me.

I want to stop paying taxes. But given my small income, this would ultimately be a ceremonial gesture that gets me fined or jailed to no avail. My question is, is there a critical mass of citizens whose refusal to pay tax would result in an inability of the government to effectively prosecute for and/or seize the withheld tax, and would this be an effective form of protest? Does such action have historical precedent?

I should point out that I am not opposed to tax. Were I to participate in such a coordinated protest, I would (and would advocate to others) give what money I would have paid in tax directly to public services, to fund education, infrastructure, healthcare, etc. and would inform the IRS I had done so.

I am open to being told I am naive and uninformed, but I want to be explained why. If "the government has always been this ___", I think this is deadly apathy we need to do something, and I will gladly "march around your City Hall" and "write to your representative" but let's not pretend that will get us out of another unwinnable, uninformed, unaffordable war.
TL;DR:
