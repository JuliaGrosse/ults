TITLE: Me [27F] with my SO [28M]. Together 7 years. He doesn't want to get married but will if I change my surname to his, but I don't want to.
POST: Hi Reddit!

I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable in my demands, or a suggestion on how to mediate this and come to a conclusion.

My boyfriend (lets call him Dan) has never wanted to get married, but isn't particularly against it. He just thinks it's pointless, but has revealed that he will get married if it's important to me. However, when I mentioned that I wouldn't want his name, he got really hurt and upset that I wouldn't take his name.

I don't want his name because honestly, I think it sounds stupid. It's a target for getting bullied in class should our kids have his name. I like my name and I don't even want to double barrel his name in. He doesn't know this though, he thinks that it's just my name meaning a lot to me.

He has said that if I won't do something which means a lot to him (taking his name), then he doesn't want to get married. He thinks he's already done quite a lot for me (he's vegan because of me, although I didn't make him vegan I didn't want non-vegan things in the house and he has respected that). However I suspect that he's only doing this because he wants me to do something for him which I don't want to do, rather than something he particularly wants. Kind of like 'Well I'm doing this thing I don't want to do, why can't you?'.

Our relationship isn't in peril or anything, I'm very happy with him and we're planning to have children soon (he's even agreed to raise the kids vegan!). I'd just like an outside perspective.
TL;DR:
