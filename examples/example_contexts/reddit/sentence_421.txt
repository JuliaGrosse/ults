TITLE: M22 Still a Virgin, Some advice?
POST: Okay, throwaway here.

So, uhh, well I've never had a "real" girlfriend. I've had two online girlfriends, one who I traveled half way across North America to meet. We made out while I was there, it's the only time I've ever kissed a girl. 

I'm a small guy, I'm not really all that shy actually, but I have a hard time relating to people and people often think I'm much younger than I actually am (A few weeks ago, two people asked me what high school I go to when I just graduated from university last weekend...). 

I can carry on a conversation well, but I don't get social cues and I have a hard time just joking around. I have a passion for cars and when I'm not at work, I'm in a garage working on cars. This means that I'm not out meeting people very often. I go to bars, on occasion but I feel really out of place there and I don't like them.

I just don't feel all that comfortable in social settings. I'm fine at work, because I know what kind of interactions I'm supposed to have. Or at school, because there's something that needed doing. But when there's no clear expectation of anything, I have no idea what to do or say. I'm one of those guys who people always tell me how smart I am, but yet I'm oblivious to the subtle social cues that people exhibit. I try to watch for them and study them, but they're hard to replicate.

I just want to connect to people, to feel comfortable around them and to enjoy being around them. Right now, if I spend too much time around people, I begin to feel really drained.

Sorry for the long post.
