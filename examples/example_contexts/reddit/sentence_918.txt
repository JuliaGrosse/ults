TITLE: I [M/15] have a crush on a classmate [F/15] and not sure what to do.
POST: I've been interested in this girl for quite some time now(We'll call her Anne, because that's her real name) but I am only recently starting to want a make a move. As a teenager I obviously have no experience talking to women much less people as I don't exactly have a way with words.

The girl in question is in 3 of my classes and we don't usually talk, nor do we sit close enough to start a conversation. In the halls she usually goes the opposite of my way getting to class and never goes to her locker, instead just class to class, followed by her friends, so I can never get her alone. Even when we walk across each other I freeze up and can never say anything, or even look at her, which is mostly my fault and I'm trying to fix that.

However, we do have play practice together but, again, she is surrounded by friends and we have no parts together (unless its dancing with the entire cast).

Basically, how can I start a conversation with this girl? I'd like to get to know her better, even if it takes baby steps. I know this is probably teenage problems but I can't ask my parents since they will (and have) belittle me about it. I'm comfortable talking to girl friends but initiating conversation with a girl I'm interested in and can never have time to talk during class is a whole other thing.

I'm willing to share more information if more is needed.
