TITLE: M[21] I am about to ask a F[20] out, but see her rarely in person. Help me out here!!!
POST: So as I mentioned in the title, I have a class with this girl and we hit it off good (from what I can tell). We chat before class begins and text every so often, and we see each other personally in class every Tuesday and Thursday. I really like her and want to ask her out for coffee. But there is a problem, I don't want to ask her in class (i.e. its a strict lecture like class), and the only time I would get a chance to ask her personally is after class. The problem with this is that she always walks out with her friend EVERY SINGLE TIME. I figured that calling her is the next best thing. Is this okay, I need to know if it is or not.
TL;DR:
