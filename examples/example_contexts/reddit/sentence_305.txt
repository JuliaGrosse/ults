TITLE: What's the most dickish thing you've done to a friend that you really regret?
POST: The idea for this came from [this thread] but what about the dickish things like this that you've done to your friends?  
  
A couple of years ago, I had a friend that I was basically inseparable from. We rode to and from school together, and we basically hung out every day. We always had a really awesome time hanging out, and he always made me laugh about everything. He was a hilarious dude. But one day I found out that he had smoked some pot, which I wasn't a fan of him doing. It was the first time he did it, but at the time, I had a very XxStraightxEdgexX mentality, so I thought I was above everyone who smoke and drank, etc. So, after I found out that he had gone and done that, I waited for the school year to end, and I made the decision that I wasn't going to be friends with him anymore. I completely quit talking to him, deleted him from Myspace(yeah, it was back then.), and even took his number out of my phone.  It was several months before I tried to talk to him again, but I eventually realized how big of an ass I was being, so I sent him a long email apologizing for being so insensitive and closed-minded. I had found out from third parties that he sank into a real deep depression because I quit talking to him, and he refused to go anywhere in public that he might run into me.  We're on good terms now. Things are slightly tense because of the long period of not talking to each other, but they've somewhat returned to normal, but I sincerely regret that decision. I don't think we'll ever be as close as we were, and it was real shitty of me to be that way towards him.
TL;DR:
