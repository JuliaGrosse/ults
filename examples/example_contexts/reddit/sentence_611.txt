TITLE: Me [19 M] with my (ex)Crush [19 F], rejected me even though the signs were clear?
POST: I knew her for a few months and she's a great, funny, and kind person. Anyhow, I wanted to move on to the next level, so a mutual friend forced me to go shopping with them (plus I needed to buy something). 

At a certain store, I saw a VERY attractive girl and I wanted to talk to her but couldn't because my crush and my friends were there. So I didn't do much. 

Fast Forward 1 day

I was talking to my group of friends and I explained to them that I saw a SUPER attractive girl the other day and we were talking about her (and laughing). My crush walks in the room and says that she wants to laugh too, so my friends tell her what happened to me the other day, what I saw, and what I wanted to do. I was watching her reaction and she just said "oh". 

So she decided to leave shortly after that and she starts to sniff a LOT. I thought she had a cold or something but took no real notice but now I know her, she was crying. 

I used this info, confessed to her the week after that, and she brotherzoned me.

So what happened?
TL;DR:
