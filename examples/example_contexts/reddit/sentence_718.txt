TITLE: My[21 F] boyfriend [21 M] of 6 months, has been losing his hair. He's going through a lot of emotional problems because of it.
POST: My boyfriend and I are both Juniors in college.

He's been experiencing hair loss since he was 18. Since we've started dating, this issue has come up in bits in pieces to where I'm away of the problem, and how insecure it makes him feel. I try to reassure him, and generally just never bring it up. If he mentions it, I tell him I love him whether he has hair or not, how attractive i find him, etc etc. Up until now, it's usually worked out fine; he realizes he shouldn't stress, and we go on to what we were doing.

Well, recently we had brought up the issue of graduation and I mentioned some new grad schools i was considering. He got upset, but this somehow eventually led to him breaking down and bringing up that he had lost more hair in the shower that morning. We talked, and he admitted it's a big self-esteem thing for him, which of course makes sense. We discussed him seeing a dermatologist, but he's researched before, and I now have too, and it seems all he can do is just accept it, since the medication has sexual side effects, which is not something he (or I for that matter) can accept.

So, he'll make an appointment with a dermatologist once spring break is over, but I'm starting to get worried about how to help him. I really have no idea what to do or say. I try and reassure him, but it seems like such a personal problem that, no matter how much I say he looks great, the fact that he's only 21 and losing his hair is tough.  He has no bald spots, but it's thinning, and that enough is bad.

What can I do? Should I just not bring up this and make it a taboo topic? Should I talk to him more about it? Or just do as I am now and accept that that's all I can do? Thank you. I've never seen him that upset before, and it's really made me start worrying.
