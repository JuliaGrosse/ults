TITLE: Dating advice for a wounded airman that has never dated
POST: Howdy everybody!  

I'm not too good at prefacing stuff like this so I'll just jump right into it. 

So, I'm a 22 year old guy in the Air Force and I have never asked a girl out before... Kind of strange, I know. But even in high school, I was busy training and working out, so I never really got into the dating game. 

Unfortunately, I was injured during my last time abroad. As a result, I've gained quite a few new scars on my body. Only one on my head, on my forehead. Other than that, they're all on my upper body. 
So, I've decided to start going out and hopefully dating since I have at least a year to recover. 

However, while I was in the hospital, I gained about 50 pounds. Now that I'm out, I'm not allowed to work out since it may exacerbate my injuries. I do take a light walk everyday. I do have to eat a high calorie diet, so it's doubtful I will be able to lose much weight for at least 6 months. 
I've always been a really big guy, but right now I'm 6'4" with 24 inch shoulders and weighing in at a massive 300 pounds. 

Now that I've gone through background stuff, I can hop into my questions. I'm not sure how to approach women or even how to start a conversation with them. Also, where is it acceptable and unacceptable to approach someone? And, how do I make sure a woman is is comfortable when I approach, and to keep from appearing dangerous or creepy?

I've tried online dating without much luck, as well. I think I may have the same issue with conversations and first messages/approaching. 

I'm sure this has been posted before, so I apologize for making a new post. I felt like my background may be slightly unique.  Sorry for the wall of text, as well. 

I really appreciate any insights and advice y'all can give me! Thanks for reading!
