SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [24F] with my boyfriend [21M] Of 6 months and I am just totally mind boggled. Help.
POST: Apologies if this is a bit of a shaky post but it's my first ever post in Reddit! Anyway, I've been in a relationship for six months and it's the first relationship I've been in that I feel respected in and that actually is healthy. I have had a past habit of picking men that like to cheat have been mentally and physically abusive which has knocked my confidence a bit. 

So, my boyfriend always replies to my texts (it s a long distance relationship), he never hides anything and is one of the most intelligent people I've ever met and I feel incredibly lucky to have him in my life as he treats me so well.

However, the problem is me. One minute I'm so happy and then the next I have a panic about the relationship and I question aspects of it and make up problems that in reality are non existent. I don't really understand why I feel so up and down about things and I don't know if it's normal to feel like this in a great relationship?! Any experiences of people or advice would be greatly appreciated!
TL;DR:
