TITLE: I [21M] feel trapped, like I can't get in a relationship without losing my bestfriend.
POST: Hi all,

It's been a long 7 years of me being in love with my bestfriend, 19F, we have had the occasional fling between us and she has always said that their is potential between us in the future, I feel like i'm holding on to hope. 

I love her to pieces and can't move on, in the back of my head I am hoping for there to be something between us one day.. when that day will ever come, idk. She leads me on and we have sex occasionally which probably makes it worse for me..

Basically, I have tried to tell her that if I was to find somebody else, that she would most likely have to be gone out of my life, like realistically what sort of girl would allow their boyfriend to continue speaking/seeing a girl that they have previously loved for 7 years? Not going to happen. I've spoke to her about this and she's like what so if you got with someone you're going to ruin our friendship? We are best friends blabla you can't just do that, and I couldn't, I feel like I really couldn't ditch her as a bestfriend as she means so much to me. 

I'm terrible with writing and their is probably much more to it than what I have put up there but yeah, I feel like i'm trapped of not being able to get with anyone without losing her as a bestfriend, + I don't think i'd actually be able to see anyone else with her as my bestfriend anyway because of the feelings I have for her.
TL;DR:
