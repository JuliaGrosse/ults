TITLE: I live with my parents but I make I think ok money.
POST: Hi Personal Finance. I come from an Asian family where my father recently passed away. He left me a sum of money which I immediately used to pay off my student loans and my car loans. My sister and mother also pooled their share with me to pay off the house we live in so my mother can have a restful end of days with her grandson. Now, I have a 401k set up with my employer that matches up to 6% with me putting 15% total on it. I am 28 years old and have about 41k in savings with roughly 20k-ish in 401k. I am planning on getting married, but due to our cultural upbrining, its either getting married expensively or saving up to buy a house. Not two at the same time. My gf works retail at around minimum wage and is planning on finishing her school which then removes any form of income for her. I make about 78k. My check per month comes out at about 3100 per month. I split the cost of living, such as utilities with my sister and her husband. Would I be able to buy a house soon? I understand its about 20% of down payment but I am unsure. I am not good with money, I usually just throw it in savings so I come to PF to hear any advice. Thank you so much for helping me out. My gf and I are stressed out what to do with her schooling and myself "Trying" to plan our life out.
TL;DR:
