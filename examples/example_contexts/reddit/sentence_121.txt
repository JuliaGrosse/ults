SUBREDDIT: r/books
TITLE: I havent read a book in ages, I need a recommendation.
POST: I have never been a big reader, but now it is summer and I have a lot of time on my hands and I really want to get back into it. Here is some background. The only books Ive ever read for pleasure were Harry Potter and some other kids/young adult books when I was young. Most recently I read the Hunger Games just so I could get back into a reading habit.

What Im looking for is something to move past the young adult level, I want something with a little more depth to it, something I can sink my teeth into, that will make me think but also not bore me to death (I am easily distracted). In high school my favorite classics taught in class were *A Farewell to Arms*, *A Tale of Two Cities*, and *To Kill a Mockingbird*.

Im not necessarily looking for more classics, although if there is one you recommend please share. I've heard much about The Dark Tower series, thats currently what Im considering the most right now, any opinions? Basically the main criteria is that I want something INTERESTING and not too difficult.
TL;DR:
