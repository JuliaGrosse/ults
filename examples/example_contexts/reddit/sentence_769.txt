TITLE: Pre-Nup: He asked me to sign... and then trouble started....
POST: Hi,
I'm 26/f and have been engaged to a older man for 7 years. We are finally getting married in 2 months!

I always knew a pre-nup would be on the table, because I make far less than he does (I work for a nonprofit... he has a company). But, it didn't matter to me, as I don't plan on getting divored.

So, he gives me a pre-nup and the name of a lawyer to call. The lawyer looks at the pre-nup and says it is totally unfair. Basically, everything is 100% separate - no shared property, no marital property. The house, the art, furniture, etc is 100% his. I get 1/50th his net worth in alimony, spread out over 10 years. No matter how long we are married, it's a set amount. There are also some things about waving rights to his will. 

To me, that wasn't so bad - after all, he paid for it all. But, the lawyer said its not right. So, I go to him, and say the lawyer said certain elements are not fair or normal. He blows up. 

He said I am "Showing my true colors" and being entitled. I tell him I don't even want more, but we should talk about certain elements ( like some kind of tiering if we are married over 10 years). 

Now he is so mad he wants to call off the wedding. Words have been hurled. It's not pretty. 

Am I out of line? Have I ruined things? How can I make it better? Help!
TL;DR:
