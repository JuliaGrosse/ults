TITLE: My girlfriend (30F) of a year and I (29M) just broke up. But there's a wtench in this one...
POST:...we're both married. Please hold the judgement and bashing. I know I was wrong, I'm not proud of it, and that's actually why we broke up.  

We both realized that while we love each other, what we're doing is completely fucked up. We decided to stop seeing each other and do the right thing, focus on our spouses. We parted ways on good terms but agreed that we should cut off all contact completely.  

How do I get over this? I'm looking forward to making things right with my wife and getting back to where we have been in the past. But I've got to go through the grieving process without any support. No one knew about the affair, and the only one who I could possibly talk to it about is the one who I absolutely cannot contact or else we'd fall back into the same pattern.
