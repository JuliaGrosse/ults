TITLE: Do You Have Any Hotel Horror Stories?
POST: I currently work the front desk in a hotel. I don't think this is my worst story, but it is the most recent and awfully infuriating. Today a lady demanded her money back because, according to her, a piece of bed spring that was hanging out of the bottom of her bed injured not one, not two, but three of her family members. I guess the first injury didn't convince the other two so they had to jam their legs against it as well. The lady was also a member of our corporation's membership program, so they knew exactly how to complain if they didn't get what they wanted. These complaints would damage our score in the corporation and could cause some penalties, so it was just easier to give the lady what she wanted. We credited the money back to her debit card. The family had a 1 PM checkout, but by 2 PM they were still hanging around and in no hurry to leave. I finally lit a fire under their asses. When they did leave, they had three cars fully packed with what couldn't have been less than 12 people. They were in a 4 person room. For three nights. The housekeeper, who was supposed to get off at 3 PM, then spent the next 4 hours cleaning what had to be the most disgusting thing I ever saw. They left: 4 HUGE garbage bags of trash that were spilling across the floor, cigarette butts all over the floor, weird, smelly stains in the bathroom and tub, and, of course, no towels, washcloths, or tip. And the bed spring was fine. The lady then had the nerve to call for the rest of the day complaining that we never credited her account. I tried to explain as calmly as possible that the process takes 48-72 hours to go through, but she would hear none of it. I found out later in the day that she complained through the membership program anyway.

So, I ask you reddit, what are your hotel horror stories, whether as an employee or a guest?
