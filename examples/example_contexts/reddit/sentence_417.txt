TITLE: [17/M] My Girlfriend [17/F] has a step-brother that's trying to do inappropriate stuff with her.
POST: She brought this up to me a couple nights ago when he tried it again. She said that when she was younger, let's call the step-brother Gary(He's in his early twenties I would think), Gary had done this often. The other night Gary came into my girlfriends room, where she usually sleeps with her sister but she was not there. My girlfriend was alone, and Gary got in her bed and started touching her boobs. My girlfriend told him it was weird and that she had a girlfriend, trying to get him to stop. But he didn't care. He tried to go under her shirt, but she didn't let him. After that he tried touching between her legs, but she said she was on her period to make him stop. At that point he left. She sent me a text telling me this happened shortly after.

She told me, trusted it in me, and told me not to tell ANYONE because she didn't want her already slightly dysfunctional family to fall apart. I woke up my mom and told her however, because I was, and still am, very worried about my girlfriend.

I've tried convincing her to tell her mom but she's very very scared. Gary was in the Air Force, so she's very scared to argue with him or use physical force to stop him if he tries again. The next day after the first incident that she told me of, everyone but her and Gary were going to leave the house. She was going to be alone with Gary. I told my mom this and I picked her up at 9 A.M. To prevent stuff from happening.

Today, school started back up. She's very sick, so she's home. However, the problem is that her dad will be gone and her mom will be asleep most of the day... So there's nothing preventing Gary.

I don't know what to do. I'm frightened and worried for her. What do I do?!
