TITLE: I'm not a lazy idiot anymore, and I love it
POST: I used to be super lazy, out of shape, overly sarcastic, socially awkward, you name it. But around a month ago, I realized what was stopping me from becoming a better person was myself; I was just judging myself for wanting to become one of those "stupid" positive motivational kids. But I decided to exercise daily, limit myself to an hour of gaming each day (I was SUPER addicted to Minecraft) and do some arts and music.

Boy it feels wonderful. I now love piano and no longer have to piss off my piano instructor. I found foraging, which I love. I've got plenty of plans for this year already. I'm sleeping better and at more healthy times. I'm even seeing positive things in school, which I used to hate a lot.
Today I went on a game emulator. Oh, what fun! But when I got off I was fucking scared. My body ached again, it was later than I thought, and I was feeling like the old idiot me. No. I changed and 
I'm not going back.

I don't know why I wrote this. Maybe I'm hoping someone else really young will read this and change themselves. Sorry for the wall of text. I'm also sorry that I probably came off as thinking I'm perfect. I don't. No one is, and that's okay. But why not be as good as you can?
TL;DR:
