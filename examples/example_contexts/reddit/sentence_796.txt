TITLE: Me [17 M] and my ex [15 F]. I still think about her all the time
POST: We were together for only a month and a week and she broke up with me a month and a half ago. I still think about her all the time no matter what I do. I try to find distractions and things to fill the void that is created but the wound never seems to heal.

My parents are divorced and I think that might be an issue and all my friends say it will just take time but i'm worried because my relationship was only so short yet I felt so attached and now I'm worried that time may not do any more healing.

I know I'm still very young and have more relationships in the future but I'm worried that if I can't get over a one month relationship then how will I get over a year or maybe even a 2 year relationship.
TL;DR:
