TITLE: My [22] boyfriend [23] was just diagnosed with biopolar disorder. Looking for advice for dealing with this in the long term.
POST: My boyfriend of one year was just diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He's been really bothered by it this past week. I told him that it didn't matter to me and that it didn't affect our relationship.

But then I really started thinking about it and am a little bit worried. We aren't living together but have plans of moving in together in a couple of months. He has episodes of really high energy occasionally and I've seen him get extremely stressed out over seemingly little things, but other than that he's never really struck me as abnormal in any way. I'm worried that things might change when we move in together.
I'm curious as to if anyone else has experience living with an SO with bipolar disorder and if they have any advice for me.
TL;DR:
