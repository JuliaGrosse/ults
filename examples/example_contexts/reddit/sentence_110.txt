TITLE: Me [22 M] with a girl I met [18 F] we had sex last night and I don't want to meet her again
POST: I met this girl (18 years old) about 2 months ago and she started to chat with me (22 old boy). Every single conversation that we had, messenger, phone, texting she was the one who started. I never started a conversation, because I'm not interested in her. I couldn't image a relationship with her. My single interest was to have sex with her.

Last night we went out, and she invited me into her house, we stayed in the bed, we kissed, then we had sex. At the morning I told her that I need to go to work, after that she continuously sending me text messages, she called me twice and I think that she thinks that I want to have a relationship with her or she thinks that we are already in a relationship.

As I said, I couldn't imagine being in a relationship with her because I'm not interested in her. She once asked me what if we would be together? I told her: "you're cute, but I cannot image a relationship with you, I want to remain friends. No offence, okay?". I couldn't tell her directly: "Hey girl, I don't want to be with you, but let's f*ck, alright?". I have tried to be nice with her. After that she stopped texting me, but after a while, she started again. I don't want to tell her the reality on the phone, or in a text message, I want to meet her, but I don't know when. Should I wait a couple of days, ignoring her messages, or to respond after a while, like I did before?

From my point of view, my goal was reached, I slept with her. I thought that she wants the same, just to have sex.
