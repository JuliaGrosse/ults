TITLE: Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [25/F] 6 months, I think she may have undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. Is it my place to address the issue?
POST: I've been dating my current girlfriend for close to 6 months now.  Based on what I've experienced with her and what other knowledgable sources (friends with medical backgrounds) have observed she may have borderline personality disorder.

She has shared with me very personal details of her past (sexual abuse from a non family member, and a history of cutting) that indicate she has risk factors for the disorder, and based on extensive research I've done she meets much of the criteria for the disorder as well. However I am fully aware I am not a medical expert and do not have the capability to diagnose such a thing, especially a disorder as complex as BPD.

That being said, my question is not whether she may have such a disorder, but whether it is my place to broach the subject with her in the first place. I have only dated the girl for a short time now, and the disorder can be very serious, and such a conversation cannot be made lightly.

Is this something that should be left for her family to take of?  Or is it my responsibility as a person who cares for her to make her aware of what I think?  Her parents are involved in her life and have helped her through previous issues...should I contact them directly?

I'm just not sure what is appropriate in this situation.
TL;DR:
