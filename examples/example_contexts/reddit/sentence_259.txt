TITLE: TIFU by cursing in front of my friend's mom.
POST: So last weekend my friend's mom took me, her daughter, and another girl (SJ) to the mall. As we were driving there I was looking through my phone and texting a friend. So while I'm typing on my phone my friend, SJ, looked over my shoulder and made "Really?" face. This is where the fuck up begins, my friend, the daughter, told me not to curse in front of her mother, an extremely religious white woman. It was the one thing I was not supposed to do. I looked at SJ and told her, "Shut the fuck up." My friend's mother turned around and stared at me in disbelief. She then pulled out a cross from her necklace and held it in front of me asking me if I thought the lord approved of my words. I began to profusely apologize to her, but the damage was done.

Now fast forward to this weekend, yesterday the daughter, SJ, another friend of ours, and I were at a drill competition waiting for our turn to go into the box. As we were waiting the mother comes up to us to just chat a bit while we waited to compete. When she saw me she began to berate my language. She told me that my word choice was "unbecoming of a lady," that I had a potty mouth, and was a trash talker. She said all these things repeatedly as she chatted with us. It wasn't subtle either, she would be talking to her daughter saying something like, "So what are you going to do for lunch, are they selling food orâ€¦" and then she would look at me and say something like, "Your trashy friend looks tired, did she wear herself out with all that potty language?"

So yeah, that happened. I didn't mean to curse in front of my friend's mom, it just came out and I had only said one curse word. I began profusely apologizing to the mother afterwards but I'm pretty sure she disliked me now.
TL;DR:
