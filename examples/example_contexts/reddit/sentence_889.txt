TITLE: I [26/f] am having a hard time moving from "sleep over fun" to "we can do our own things together" with my boyfriend [26/m]- Any tips on being less sensitive about it?
POST: We're in the process of moving in together; he's fully moved in to our apt, I won't be 100% moved in for a few more months, but I'm spending 5-6 nights a week there.

In our year+ relationship, we never established the "doing our own thing apart while in the same space" thing. Last night we had a bit of a dumb fight (seriously dumb, it was about our opposing views on Miley Cyrus, who really neither of us care about at all), which led to hurt feelings and time spent in different rooms. We never fight this dumb. It just triggered my anxiety, made me sad that we were wasting a night, that all our evening was going to be was that dumb, dumb fight and then sleep....

We talked/reconvened at the end of the night, agreed it was dumb and that clearly we were being overly argumentative about something neither of us cared about. But whereas I saw it as a "waste of an evening" he saw it as "we have so many more evenings together." I want to see it like him, but I'm harping on how dumb it all was, and mourning the loss of time. I wish I wasn't, but I am and I'd like to just be more comfortable in times like this if we could just do our own thing and not feel so sensitive that we're not spending quality time together.
TL;DR:
