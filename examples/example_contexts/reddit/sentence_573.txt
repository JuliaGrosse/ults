TITLE: starting again
POST: Hello, i've finally pulled my self up from that depressive side and being negative about everything i see.
Now im planning my permanent-diet, (meaning that ill try stop eating stuff like cheesy stuff, or deepfried stuff)
I am learning lots of things about what to eat but im also going to workout and im not insterested in gym just yet, i was considering buying a indoor training bike, for 3 reasons. 1st i dont like biking outside, ESPECIALLY not now!, 2nd still quite a bit ashamed of my weight. 3rd i live in a city which means alot of stops and i rather just go on instead of waiting for all the traffic lights.

a entirely different thing, when working out, How will i know when enough is enough?
I've tried losing weight 2 times before (didnt go well but i got the motivation this time!) And the first days i went far to hardcore, it resulted with me not being able to move for 40 hours, my arms was locked and i had to walk on my knees. Yes very stupid, which is why im asking you, What is enough for a beginner whos very very out of shape, weights 320 pounds (6'3 feet) and don't walk more than 3000 steps a day.
TL;DR:
