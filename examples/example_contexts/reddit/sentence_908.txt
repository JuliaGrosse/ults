TITLE: Has anyone ever gone on a 'break' successfully?
POST: Hello,

Me and my girlfriend have been going out for quite a few years since we were both pretty young. We are both in college right now, finishing soon. 

We are going to be apart for a few months over the winter (trip overseas) and we are now in a weird place and I need advice. 

We are in love with each other and plan to move in together soon after my return. We started talking, and it got brought up the idea of us going on a break while i'm away so I don't have any regrets in the future in regards to sexual freedom and experience (since i have only really had one girlfriend, as she only one boyfriend).

Now it's heating up and we are both so confused. And just have no idea how to approach this. She seems to want to figure her self out more than me, but also is wildly in love with me.

Has anyone ever gone on a break for a few months and come back to the love of your life and continued your relationship? I feel it's a little more one sided because she wants to figure herself out and try new things but still wants to be with me for the rest of her life.
TL;DR:
