TITLE: My [20m] gf [18f] wants to meet up with a "kinda" friend
POST: My girlfriend of 4 months is from Russia and she has a lot of friends there. One day I was using her phone and a message popped up in Russian on Instagram and I said, oh you got a message. She told me it was a guy she kinda knew that was going to visit our city and wanted to meet up with her. Also I'm pretty sure I'll be out of town when he comes.

She said they're "kinda friends" so they're not even close. He was a friend of her ex boyfriend I think. Usually I'm cool with what she wants to do but it just strikes me odd that she wants to meet up with this guy and she's not even good friends with him, the way she said it he was like an acquaintance. He's just a single guy on work travel visa and they might meet up. When she told me she, said it in an unsure way and that they might not even meet up because she said her friends usually flake but I knew she was just saying that because she could see it striked me as odd. It happened with her female friend that visited with family, but I know they will hang out for sure. He's a single guy and probably hasn't been with Russian girls for a while and he's going to make it happen. 

But I saw online that she commented on his profile asking if he was in town yet. Should I be concerned? Is it none of my business? Is meeting up with a "kinda" friend a big deal?
TL;DR:
