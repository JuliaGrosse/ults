TITLE: I, 27M, am having money issues with GF, 24F
POST: Been dating my GF for 2 years now and we share a 1 bedroom apartment. We agreed on a few things before we moved in together. 

 * I would pay rent, 740/Month
 * She would cover utilities and internet 100-200/Month
 * We would split groceries

I work almost full time and go to school part time, full time again next semester. She works 1 night a week and spend the rest of her time training her horses. So the money she makes goes to the horses, while the money I make goes towards everything else. 

I understand that I make more and as such can contribute more, but 100% doesnt seem fair at all! I've talked to her about this several times, but nothing has changed. 

How do I get her to find a second job?! All I can really think of is threatening her, but I don't want to do that. I love her very much, but I am getting very tired of getting up early to go to a job I hate and going to school while she gets to get up late every morning and go about her day as she pleases. 

I understand that we are in this together, but I just want to feel like I am being treated fairly.
TL;DR:
