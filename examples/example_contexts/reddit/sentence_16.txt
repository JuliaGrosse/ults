TITLE: Please help reddit... I had my wisdom teeth out Tuesday, dry sockets in all sockets developed Thursday, today some bastard gland on my neck is swollen like a tennis ball, everything I swallow feels like razor blades, and I'm going overseas in a week
POST: Warning, this is a repost because I'm paranoid.  Also, I'm anatomy stupid.  I think this is a gland. Its on my neck in the area you would feel if you were checking your pulse on your carotid artery.  

Please if there are any dentists type do you know if the tonsil swelling is normal after developing dry sockets? i had the first medication applied Thursday, I'm going back Monday. On Thursday I had a fever so bad it was 89 degrees out and i was still shivering even though I had on full sleeves and pants, a coat, had a small heater blowing on me, and was under a blanket. My teeth were clattering so much it was hurting the sockets. Migraine was so bad I couldn't walk.  Since the medication my fever has reduced drastically but my throat now hurts so bad its difficult to describe. Even swallowing my own spit feels like razor blades in my throat. Gargling salt water helps a tad but even hydrocodone does not relieve this pain. I am leaving America in a week and I am scared

The reason this is freaking me out is because I can not remember having any gland or tonsil swelling ever in my life, even as a kid.  It's the weekend now so the dentist is gone till Monday :(

I just need to know if this sort of thing is normal or if I should go to an ER or something?
TL;DR:
