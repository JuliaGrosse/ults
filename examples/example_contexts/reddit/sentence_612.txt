TITLE: Negotating pay rise/better conditions in current job - how to do it, what tips?
POST: Hi Reddit,

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!
TL;DR:
