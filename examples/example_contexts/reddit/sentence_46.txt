TITLE: Have a crush and want to take it the next level. How should I proceed?
POST: OK so I like this girl (She is a junior and I'm a sophomore in highschool) and she was dating this guy I was friends with when I first met her. They broke up about 2 weeks ago and my friend keeps saying that he is over her. I'm not gonna lie this girl is a little bit out of my league but I really think she likes me because one day last week we were talking in the hallway and she randomly asked to see my hand, she then proceeded to write her number on my hand. I had never previously asked her for it so I found it a bit weird, once again I'm not gonna lie I'm not exactly a Laddies' man. Fast forward about a week nothing has happened other than talking to each other in the hall and texting daily. Homecoming is coming up on a couple of weeks and of course with my luck it is girls ask guys. I thought to myself, "Screw it, I'm just gonna ask her." This was yesterday, of course some other asshole asked her that morning. (I don't see her until lunch.) This guy is one of her ex's from last year and she said she might give him another chance. This guy has a little bit of an advantage over me because he is also a junior, taller, plays guitar, and has a sweet beard. I was texting her last night and asked her if she was with that dude and she said no, but I'm thinking about it. I replied, "I'm going to warn you, and I speak from personal experience, the relationship ended the first time for a reason." She then texted back, "You're right." The best I could think to say was, "You do you, but consider this fair warning." No response. I'm really stumped here and honestly have no idea what to do next.
TL;DR:
