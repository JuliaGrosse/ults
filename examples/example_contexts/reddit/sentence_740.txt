TITLE: Denied rental application due to being a graduate student engaged to a medical student what are my options?
POST: Hello,

First time poster here. Here are the basic parts of what I'm trying to figure out. My fiance and I live in an apartment now for about 450/month and we just got rejected from an apartment in another town for about 100 more per month. We both have savings and great credit and live now on student loans and contribute equally to rent and other expenses. Our current landlord even offered to write us a letter of recommendation as we have never missed a payment.
The apartment in question didn't even seem to understand what we were talking about when we told her about our allotment for the year being about 2x how much they were even charging for rent. We can be allotted about 600 each for housing and we would only need less than 300. 
Between the two of us we could pay rent just off of savings for the next year and a half, but now they won't talk to us. 

I know what they are doing isn't illegal (at least I don't think it is,) but is there a way that I can show them our student loan packages as income so that they will understand that we can very much so afford the place? We are both very interested in the location because it was so cheap and we are careful of our finances, and the next option next to that apartment is about 690/month which we don't really want to pay if we don't have to.

Honestly if I were a landlord I would almost prefer student loans from a med student and grad student because it's basically a guarantee of having rent money with little to no volatility. I guess I'm just confused about why the landlord would not accept us or even understand the concept of loan package housing.
TL;DR:
