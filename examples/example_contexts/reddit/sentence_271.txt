TITLE: Me [17 M] with my long distance girlfriend [17 F] have a bit of an issue that might seem silly
POST: I've been with my long distance girlfriend for almost 4 months now, and our relationship has been pretty great and we will finally be together in just a few months.

Now we had a talk today, and we got into not quite an argument, but a discussion about a problem. We talk on Skype daily, and whenever we do she always seems to be covered up more, ie. today she wore a flannel and usually as a girl you'd button it down, and she specifically buttons it all the way up prior to talking to me. We've talked about it before and she says she wants that to be more of a suprise, but I think it's pretty silly that she walks around showing cleavage but completely covers up for me. I told her I don't think it's fair that literally any guy can look down her shirt at anytime, yet she entirely covers up for me. She says it's because I'm important and that everybody else doesn't matter, but I guess I don't see that, I see it more as if others get to see more than I do and that's kind of shitty. It's not as if I haven't seen her chest before, and yes, I've met her in person, and so I'm not sure why this is such a big deal to her, but it makes me feel kind of insignificant in a way, that a random kid at her school can see more than I, her boyfriend can.

I know this is a silly problem, and she's a fantastic girlfriend and we kind of talked this out, but we didn't really get anywhere. There are no hard feelings, bit I guess I feel as if the issue still isn't resolved.
TL;DR:
