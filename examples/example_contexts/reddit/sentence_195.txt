TITLE: My 1 1/2 year old cat has apparently forgotten about the litterbox. Any advice greatly appreciated!
POST: My roommate moved in in Sept. with two cats, each 1 1/2 years. I have since adopted the slightly-overweight male cat, and roommate moved home 2 days ago and took the other cat with her. Today while doing laundry I found cat turds in my towel pile...and upon checking the litterbox realized that he hasn't been using it at all. It's in the same place, it's the same one he's always used, litter is the same brand. A few hours later I walk by the litterbox and he's pooping three feet away from it on the rug...

My roommate never really kept the box clean, so could it maybe be that I cleaned it & put new litter in it soon as she left? I thought maybe it could be the absence of the other cat in some way, but they've been separated for up to two months before. He's eating the same brand & amount of food. 

Has this happened to anyone? What could be causing this, & how do I stop it before there are secret turds everywhere?!
(I will add that this is the first cat I've had.)
TL;DR:
