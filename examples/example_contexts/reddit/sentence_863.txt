SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Not sure how to feel about what happened, distressed. Advice greatly appreciated.
POST: This is a re-post from r/rape but I figured I would post it here too because it's something that I need to get off my chest.

A couple of months ago, my boyfriend wanted to try anal sex. I agreed, however, as soon as he started penetrating me, I realized I didn't want to go through with it because it was uncomfortable and painful. I started saying "stop" repeatedly and at first, he was still inside me. He didn't pull out immediately, but after about 20 seconds he did. ( The details of this encounter are hazy because it was awhile ago). I basically curled up into a little ball after he pulled out, and then he started asking me if I was okay, what was wrong, etc. I told him I was annoyed that he didn't stop after my first initial "stop" and he told me that he didn't mean to disregard what I was saying, but that he basically just didn't know if I wanted him to pull out completely or to just stop thrusting or whatever. 

Anyway, fast forward to the present. Now when we're being intimate, I sometimes think of that experience and I feel violated. It makes me feel detached and disconnected, and kind of gross. I don't feel like I was actually raped, but I also don't feel super great about what happened either. I would really appreciate someone's perspective on this.
TL;DR:
