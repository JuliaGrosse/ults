TITLE: Me [29F] with my bf[28 M] 4 years, use of pornography and sex life
POST: Obvious disclaimer throwaway.

My bf and I have been together for 4 years. Our sex life is sort of lost its spark, (we have sex once a week, sometimes every two weeks and this last week, he withed sex because he was upset and wanted to "punish" me, because he was mad,  which was really controlling and not ok). 

 This aside, there have been some issues that have arisen with pornography. I discovered that he was looking at camgirls and paying them. They were not private chats or private shows,  but I asked him to stop, just because it crossed a boundary,  vaguely cheating to be interacting with live girls. So, he stopped paying for live cam shows.

However, I just discovered that he paid and downloaded a 3 videos of a camgirl (not a "live" show, just bootlegged/recorded versions of the live show, so he wasn't paying her to take off the clothes). BUT-- it was the same cam girl he was looking at, and paying for,in the past. A girl that I look nothing like, different race, different body type, 10 years younger than me...which makes me feel insecure. I am fine with masturbation and sexual expression, but not when it seems to be getting in the way of our own intimacy. 

The real problem is, he masturbates more than we have sex. I consider myself to be an attractive, educated, well rounded, funny, pretty, and  sexual person. This is starting to make me feel undesirable, insecure and sexually powerless. I've never had these feelings before.  For some reason, he'd rather tug his own than be intimate with me. Now, I don't really feel comfortable. He's witheld sex, and then is masterbating to girls that look nothing like me. 

 I've discussed this with him, but he gets really defensive and insists that there is nothing wrong and tells me to "relax."  I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with him over this issue, but it's hurting me. Advice?
TL;DR:
