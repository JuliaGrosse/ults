TITLE: Helping GF 27 get over her trust problems.
POST: I(27) have been with my girlfriend(27) for about 10 months now. Even though the relationship is going great, my girlfriend is afraid that I'm going to leave here. I have no plans of doing that because she's great and I want to marry her one day. I've told her that and she's alright but every once in a while, she starts saying "what if you leave me, I don't want that. I love you so much it hurts, etc" and she thinks that her breaking off the relationship would be better. I talk to her and calm her most of the time and it's alright. It only happens when she's not with me, hence over the phone which is hard for me to control as I can't physically comfort her.
Alright, it's happened again while I was typing this. She says she can't "do me any more harm by being negative like this and hopes I have a good life. She loves me and misses me always" (I don't get annoyed or harmed, I just want us to be happy. She's amazing and I love her tonnes and she's just amazing)
I don't want to leave her. Any suggestions on what can be done?
TL;DR:
