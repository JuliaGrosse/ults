TITLE: I'm an apprentice, how can I save?
POST: I work at a cinema, I'm 17 and in the UK. I earn £5.20 an hour and I get a minimum of 16 hours (not enough to live on) and a maximum of 30 hours. 

I currently still live with my parents, they don't charge me for rent, but rightly so, anything I want, be it food for work or games, travel etc. Theyll make me pay.

I currently have about £300 in my bank, that's it. I have a student rail-card, entitling me to cheaper fares but I still have to pay about £3.45-£5.00. 

There are times that I am working before 10 am, which doesnt allow me to use my rail card, meaning it costs £7.30 for a return ticket from my home to work.

I'm on this apprenticeship for 2 years, I just started in September. Perks are free cinema tickets and 40% off food and drink, but its not financially beneficial or worth mentioning really..

Basically, what can I do to save more? I get paid every 2 weeks, and I used to put £20 in an envelope to save up, but I had to use that £20 because my debit card broke one time, so now I don't have any left aside. 

People do laugh at my stupidly low wages, others call me stupid or say it was a mistake for working there..
TL;DR:
