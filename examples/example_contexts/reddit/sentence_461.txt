TITLE: TV show argument. Was I really in the wrong?
POST: So my housemate was watching the Philly's game and it was the bottom of the 6th inning and I wanted to watch the new South Park. So I changed the channel and he got pissed that he was missing the 7th inning. Well, by the time South Park was over it became the bottom of the 7th inning. In the end, we ended up watching a good portion of the end of the 6th inning because of commercial break and I missed about 5 minutes of South Park because he wanted to finish the bottom of the 6th inning. And then while South Park was on he ended up missing the top of the 7th.

My argument was that he's got three whole innings to watch and South Park is a measly half hour of the 1.5 hours he has left of the game. Not to mention during every commercial break I switched to the game for him so he could stay updated on what happened. Also, baseball is a slow as fuck game. Like half the time nothing is actually happening, the cameras just zoom in the crowd and players that are preparing to go next.

Anyways, now he's pissed at me because I watched South Park and he missed a little over half an inning where nothing actually happened. He also thinks that because he rarely makes requests that he deserved for this one to be granted. Guy, it's fucking South Park, one of the best shows to ever grace the tube.

So what I want to know is: Am I douchebag for taking over the TV to watch my half hour of South Park? And is there anything I can say/do to smooth the situation over? He's still a little upset about it, I think to him it's now the principle of the situation, but I feel totally differently about it and I just want him to understand that sports are really not that big a deal not to mention he only cared about this team now that it's the playoffs.
TL;DR:
