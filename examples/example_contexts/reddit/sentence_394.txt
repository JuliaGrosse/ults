SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My [24F] step-second-cousin (?) [33M] asked me out on a date...I don't know how to feel.
POST: This person is my step dad (of 6 months)'s first cousin, so I guess that would make him my step half cousin? It's such a distant relationship that I don't think it matters that much, but I still feel weird about it, considering the fact that he has the same last name as my step dad. We have met a few times and gotten along great, but I didn't think of it as more than that until this happened. I think he's cool and everything and would probably consider opportunity if I didn't consider him *part of the family*.  BUT then again, we are nowhere near blood related, not even distantly, so?
TL;DR:
