TITLE: Severely depressed girlfriend, needs help. What can i do?
POST: My girlfriend is having a lot of emotional issues lately. She calls me nearly every night deeply upset, it usually takes me an hour or two to calm her down. She wants to seek medical help, meaning a therapist, or a counselor of some sort. Her parents have agreed sort of, but have taken no action. I am worried because it has gotten to the point to where she is severely depressed and thinks about hurting herself and throwing up sometimes because she doesnt feel good enough, she just as of a few months ago got over a eating disorder. I want to get her the help she needs but i obviously cant pay for it by myself. I dont know what i can do.
TL;DR:
