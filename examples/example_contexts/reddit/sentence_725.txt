TITLE: What do colleges care about most?
POST: I'm in my junior year of high school and I think I'm cracking from stress. I really care about college and getting scholarships, so I've been mostly focusing on academics. I think I'm in **at least** top 25 of my class. I took an AP class and got a 4 my sophomore year and have gotten at least a 90 in all of my honors classes. I was in only one club for both sophomore and freshman years, and I did winter and spring track both years.I'm in a math honors society.    
    
This year, I'm taking 4 college courses (3 are APs) and they're a LOT more difficult than my courses last year. I can handle my club once a week and taking these courses (just barely), but I keep getting told by adults that I NEED more extra-curriculars. I don't think I could handle it on top of doing track, too. Starting November, I won't be getting home until at least 5, and then I would like to take an hour for showering/eating. I don't think I'd have the dedication to complete all of my work to my full potential.    
    
My goal is NOT to go to one of the "top" schools. I want to go to a good school, but my priority isn't getting into an Ivy League school for college. Maybe transfer after a year or two, maybe, but they're pricey and I've heard they don't offer many scholarships.
TL;DR:
