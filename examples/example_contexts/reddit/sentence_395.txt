TITLE: I (28m) am clueless about coming up with a nice wedding day speech for my sister (26f) due to lack of personal stories.
POST: Situation: My sister, 26, is getting married the end of this year. I have no clue what to say for my speech during the reception dinner. 

Background: I am very happy for her and everyone is on board with the guy. Families have met each other, and they've been together almost a decade. It's not like I do not know the guy, I know him in a sense that I know what he's like, I've hung out with him. For the last 6 years, we've lived separately. Me in North America, she back in Asia where we were born and raised. It made it difficult for me to be close to her, or get to know her boyfriend to a greater extent. We were close growing up, puberty to teenage years. We were so comfortable with each other taking selfies and other playful stuff. Then at some point, for some reason, we kinda strayed. No bad bloods no ill feelings, but we weren't as close as we were before. Chalk it up to growing up and having different priorities and interests?Again, the last 6 years (we've seen each other a few times during this period) didn't help. 

Assessment: It makes it difficult for me to come up with an honest, touching brotherly speech when the day of the wedding comes. We were never the type to hang out with each other's friends when we got a little older. 

Recommendation (what I think): Part of the speech will include memories of us as kids, part of it will also admitting that the last 6 years of not being around each other didn't give us the best opportunity (maybe come off as humorous?)

I feel ridiculous because all weddings I've been to it seems like siblings have the beat stories of the bride/groom and their partners. 

Help me out?
