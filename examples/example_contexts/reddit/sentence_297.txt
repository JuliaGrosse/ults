TITLE: Me [21F] with [22M]. Can't tell if he's messing with me or just really weird/shy?
POST: I've had a crush on this guy from my gym for the past 2 years. Long story short, I found out he was interested in me back in May and we started texting.  

We always planned to meet at the gym at the same time. He actually seemed pretty shy because he would never say hi to me at the gym first. I'd always have to approach him first, but we'd have decent conversation, and he'd always hug me goodbye. We went on our first date after 2 weeks of texting & meeting up at the gym, and the date went really well, but he just stopped talking to me for no reason after this. He just ignored me at the gym and stopped responding to texts.    

Two weeks ago, we match on Tinder and I message him on there. He tells me to text him and we talk for like two days, then he disappears again.  

Two days ago, he randomly texted me and said "I wanted to talk to you at the gym, but you're always talking to other people." I asked him to just come up and talk to me, and he goes "Idk why I do or don't do things. I'm weird and just really shy." Then he send me a shirtless pic of himself.   

I saw him at the gym yesterday, we talked, and he gave me a hug before I left. I texted him today and he responded, but when I invited him to go out with me and my friends tonight, he just never replied. I don't get if he's just fucking with me or what.
TL;DR:
