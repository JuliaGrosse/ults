TITLE: TIFU by attempting to front flip off a yoga ball
POST: This happened a few days ago but the FU will linger for weeks. I was bored after a very long workday and had a brief lapse in judgement. Something in me decided it would be a good bit of fun to jump up onto the yoga ball in my living room and flip forward onto the couch. What could go wrong?

I get a running start and launch myself up onto the ball. My right leg lands perfectly on the top portion and balances. Unfortunately my left leg was a bit late to the party and the impact shot the yoga ball out from under me. I fly in the air and land on my back, head, and left wrist. I can feel my wrist hurting but most of my focus is on my ringing head. I try to stand and end up lying on the couch until I regain my equilibrium. After a few minutes my head feels fine, but my wrist continues to throb. I throw some ice on it and move my fingers around but there doesn't seem to be any real damage done. When the pain doesn't subside in a few hours I conclude I must have sprained it and resolve to go to the doctor. 

Next day I get an xray done and find out I have fractured my radius. I am getting fitted for a cast soon and will most likely be out of work for at least a month. Worst part of it? I'm a lefty.
TL;DR:
