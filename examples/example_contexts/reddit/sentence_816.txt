TITLE: Me [18M ] with my girlfriend[18F] of 1 year, broke up.Was it a good decision?
POST: Hello r/relationships. As mentioned in tittle me and my now ex-girlfriend broke up after 1 year of relationship.The problem is here, i love her and i know she loves me but we cant make it work. We are constantly arguing and breaking up or taking breaks. 
    She gets frustrated really easy. When we are together everything is fine but when we arent around eachother it is not. The communication is pretty much one sided. I talk she jut confirs says ok,aha,yes etc and other stuff. We had before much better conversation and she was interesting to me but she just isnt anymore.And also we go to class together so what do you suggest?how to deal with that? and is it good to break up for real this time?
TL;DR:
