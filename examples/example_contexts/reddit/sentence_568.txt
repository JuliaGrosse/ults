TITLE: I want to eventually get back together with my Ex... how do i approach this?
POST: I'm going to post my links from my other posts because theres a lot of information and i dont want to type it all again. if you would like to know more about my situation click on these links:

I'm 25 and I called my ex for the first time since she broke up with me 12 days ago. I really miss her and am very much in love with her. I know shes going through some stuff right now and doesnt need a serious relationship right now. We talked for an hour tonight and it was great. I asked her a couple of times if she needed to go and she always said no. At the end i told her it was good talking to her and she said it was really good talking to me too. She said i guess ill talk to you later, and i told her i'd call her in a few days or something. She seemed happy and said ok.

How do i need to approach this? I dont want to push her away or try to move too quickly. I do want her back in my life.
TL;DR:
