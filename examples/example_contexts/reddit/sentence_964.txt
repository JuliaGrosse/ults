TITLE: Another disgusting roommate question
POST: Dear Reddit, 

I'm a college student, and my roommates are absolutely disgusting.  I live in a 4 bed/4 bath apartment, and my roommates don't keep our common areas (living room/laundry area/kitchen) clean.  I understand a dish or two in the sink, but often times the kitchen sink is unusable due to their dirty dishes literally filling it up above the faucet.  Counters occasionally have food stuck on them.  Last weekend my mother and I discovered mold growing in the bottom of their trashcan (I use a different one than them), and I've found mold in the dirty dishes the majority of the times I clean the kitchen.  Additionally, they've been stealing my food (which I've fixed by using a mini-fridge.

I tried confronting them about the food stealing problem a couple weeks ago by messaging them on facebook.  While I realize this isn't the best mode of conversation, our schedules are such that we rarely encounter each other, and its difficult to get everyone together at once.  The response I got from them was a fairly confrontational "don't talk to me on facebook and don't be passive aggressive (which I wasn't doing intentionally)".  I brought things up to management a week or so ago and they said they would talk to them about it, but either management never talked to them or my roommates are ignoring them (which is highly possible, my roommates have no respect for our management whatsoever).

What should I do?  It's been 2 weeks since I tried talking to my roommates, and about a week-week and a half since I talked to management.
TL;DR:
