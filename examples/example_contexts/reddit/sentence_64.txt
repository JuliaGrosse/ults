TITLE: Me [21 M] with a girl I was seeing [20F] for 2 months went on exchange. Another girl [21F] has come into the picture.
POST: I met this girl a while back (October), clicked super well on every level and really enjoyed spending time with one another. But she went on exchange and she's gone for a year, but we talk everyday. 

Meanwhile, Ive started to see this other girl, and were exclusive (Met her around the same time but recently started putting more effort into it). We enjoy each others company and do a lot of similar activities and my friends really like her. 

Im confused as to what to do... Ive been trying to live in the moment and focus on what is right here and now but its hard to not drift back to her and think of what it would be like when [20F] comes back. At the beginning I chose [20F] who went on exchange. But as I get to know this other girl better [21F] I'm not so sure.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?
TL;DR:
