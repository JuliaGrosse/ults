POST: Title. My girlfriend of 4 years, she's 20 I'm 19 [M], has shown a loss of affection over the last several months. We've talked about it a bit and attributed it to a combination of stress, and bc.  She has switched BC twice since then, if I'm not mistaken, and has had quite a bit of stress relief through a combination of perseverance, and spa stuff. I am doing my best to be supportive of her because I know she is as worried about this as I am, however it is starting to affect my self esteem, and more recently, bringing on a recurring issue with depression. We've also discussed the possibility of her simply being bored, unattracted, or unhappy with me, all of which she denied up and down. I have run out of ideas. I just want her to be better, if not for our relationship, purely to make her happier. I need help.
TL;DR:
