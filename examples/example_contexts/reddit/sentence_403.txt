TITLE: Me [18 M] having fallen for a long time friend [17 F] after coming out of a long and unhappy relationship
POST: So I came out of a long and unhappy relationship several months ago. Throughout my recovery period I had an amazing female friend by my side. I've known here for years and she's done wonders to restore my emotional state after some things that happened in my previous relationship.

As a result of this, I've come to realise that the person I really loved was sitting on the side line while I spent two years of my life in a horrible mess of a relationship.

Now I desperately want to start a relationship with this girl, but I don't know whether it's a realistic possibility. She shows interest in me, we flirt a bit and perhaps more importantly we're totally comfortable with each other's presence, touch etc. 

However, I can't tell whether this is just because we're ridiculously close friends who've been through a lot together or because she, like me, actually feels something more. We've been there for each other for years now and I'm torn up about what to do.

Thanks for anyone who offers advice. I am more than happy to provide as much additional info as may be required.
TL;DR:
