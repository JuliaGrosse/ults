TITLE: Are white immigrants from South Africa (to America) considered African-Americans? Should they be?
POST: Should anyone who comes to America to live be considered anything other than American? Or have we forgotten George Washington's words, 

"Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. **The name of american, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.** With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together; the Independence and Liberty you possess are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes."
