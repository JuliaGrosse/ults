I was recently thrown into a situation where it became quite apparent to my family and me that an older relative was being taken by a dating scam.  Everyone knew it, it was just too obvious, but we had no hard evidence to prove it to him.  This relative has no job, no home, and sends nearly every penny of his unemployment check to these scammers.  He sold off all of his things, the last being his laptop as they convinced him they would be traveling to the US to see him soon.  I know, it's clearly a scam, it sounds preposterous and you all know it, but we just could not convince him.

I put a keylogger on the desktop he was using in order to get his email passwords, and I went in to get the photos of this "woman" (turned out to be [Raven Riley]  Their whole correspondence was sad and disgusting, spanning the past year and probably thousands upon thousands of dollars lost. 

 I felt a bit dirty snooping like that.  Just now I wrote him an anonymous email pointing out everything fake about this situation, with links to sites talking about the scam, the porn star's website, others who got taken by people using the same photos, and so fourth.  Hopefully he comes to his senses and we can be done with this, and his life will turn around before it's too late.
