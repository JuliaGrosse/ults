TITLE: I need to find a way to gain money for this month's rent. Only this month!
POST: hello I'm not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit. I am 19 years old and a full time student in college. Just some background. I was planning on getting a summer job but I got swamped with summer school. Unfortunately my school crammed two summer semester and I could no longer work due to the amount of homework and studying I had to commit to. I took summer A which has already ended and now I am in summer break. I decided since I've worked extremely hard to gain a gpa of 3.2 ( doesn't sound that high but it took me a lot of work) that I deserve a break. My mom how ever does not agree. She got mad at the idea and will now charge me rent. Should I apply for a job?  I'm already getting work study for this coming fall semester which starts  august 29. I need to gain money for just this month. She is asking for approximately $500.
TL;DR:
