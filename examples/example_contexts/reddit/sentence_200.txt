TITLE: How do I safely lower my libido?
POST: I'm a 20 year old female and I get that this is only normal considering my age but I can't handle myself anymore. I have never had sex and don't plan on it right now due to body issues etc. I masturbate everyday and sometimes more than once. I stopped watching porn because its unfulfilling and instead sext/phone sex with a guy friend of mine. I've been regularly going to the gym. Eating mostly healthy and sleeping the right amount. But regardless of all this, I feel horny almost all the time, especially with this guy friend. I've come to the point where I feel I need sex and having had a bad experience before and where I am with my self image right now, I can't get myself to participate in sexual intercourse. Please let me know of any ways I can help lower my libido. Thank you
