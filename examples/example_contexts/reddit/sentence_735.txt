TITLE: Me [30F] with my friend [33 M], feel like i'm unable to help, thinking of throwing in the towel. (social anxiety)
POST: My friend has crippling social anxiety. He has no friends and his only contacts are his father and stepmother. The harsh truth is, he's not too attractive physically and mentally. Physically, he's like a 3 and mentally he's constantly having a victim complex, complains over everything and his conversations revolve around the negative things that have happened to him.

He's never had a relationship and hasn't had friends for about 10 years. Anyone he's interacted him has eventually spurned him after learning that he is clingy.

I can understand that years of rejection have made him bitter, but the only way to improve his life is to let go of that.

I feel like no matter what I say to him or how many plans I make for him to help him, he will insist on letting the negativity colour his world. 

The only thing that stops me from not caring is the fact that he has helped me in the past. The only problem is, i'm feeling like my attempts to help him are futile and fruitless.

A while ago I sent him a long email telling him how to fix his life - to work on confidence, how to be part of communities, how to improve himself to look and feel better. He didn't listen to any of it. He essentially said 'this is who I am and you don't understand me at all.'
TL;DR:
