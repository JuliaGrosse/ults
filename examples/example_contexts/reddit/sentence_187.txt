SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [20/M] have a girlfriend [20/F] but I kind of fell in love with a new girl [17/F]
POST: Hey! Here is my story: I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend 4,5 years now. Last week I've met a girl (that also has a boyfriend), she talked to me at a party. I have not met here since then, but I will meet her tomorrow at another party. It is the final party of her exchange programm. Yep, she is an exchange student and will leave in 2 days...

But I kind of fell in love. I always think about her. Sometimes we are talking on facebook and she even said that I'm cute. (Don't know if that's much...)

Since I have a girlfriend for such a long time, I'm not really into these flirty things anymore tbh. What should I do, /r/relationships? **Tell her that I fell in love?** **Or is it better to not say anything?** I'm confused because I never thought I would meet someone that attracts me more than my girlfriend.
TL;DR:
