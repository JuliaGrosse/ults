TITLE: How can I [20F] build trust in my relationship and my boyfriend [20M] of almost two years?
POST: Let me start by saying, my boyfriend is a great guy. It has been a rocky relationship but time and time again he has proven that he is willing to put all the effort that is needed to make things work. He has helped me became a better person, helped me get over a lot of issues I have had with myself, and has always been there for me. He is never cheated, and is very open and honest with me. He's an frequent Reddit user so I can't really go into specifics, but incase he does fuck it, it'll be a nice reminder to him how much he means to me. 

So what's the problem? Well to give a bit of background my parents divorced when I was little, not only that but for some reason I was mostly surrounded by unhealthy relationships. I don't dwell on it much and have never thought it affected me. 

Sometimes this irrational fear comes over me that he must be fucking me over, more specifically that he is cheating on me. I have no reason to believe it other than I can't tell who he occasionally texts. And so far the times I have figured out, it's just friends or family. It's completely ridiculous. Just certain situations or thoughts trigger this overwhelming feeling that he must be doing something wrong. There's very little I can do to shake it off. 

I must emphasise that this is mostly comes from me just over thinking. 

I want some advice on how I can get out of the habit of thinking this things, or dealing with this insecurities. I know this could be something that ends our relationship and I really don't want that.
TL;DR:
