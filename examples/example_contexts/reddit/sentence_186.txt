TITLE: I just lied about having a job...
POST: In May, I graduated from University after 7 years, 4 universities, and 3 road trips across the US. It feels fucking good man. It was a wild ride and I enjoyed it all. There was shit and there was happiness (a lot of both actually). I met some great people that have become family. After graduating, I decided to work one more summer for maintenance at the university. I have grown to hate my job and everything about it, so I decided last week that I was going to move home - something I had planned on doing in august. Today I told my friends that I got a job and that is the reason why I am leaving. Truth is, I don't have a job. I have three interviews in my home city. I'm excited about moving back because I love my city and my family and my friends. But I feel like shit that I lied to these people I consider family. I just didn't want to deal with them questioning me why I was leaving without a job. The problem with the lie - other than I love these people - is that I am a superstitious guy. I hope I didn't just fuck myself in the karma department and lost all three opportunities. Things will turn out alright, I just needed to tell someone.

Thanks for reading this wall of text.
