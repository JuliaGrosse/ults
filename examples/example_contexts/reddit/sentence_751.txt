TITLE: TIFU by breaking my girlfriend's nose
POST: This one actually happened this morning... I'm in college, so I decided to sleep over at my girlfriend's house last night after we got done doing some homework. After doing our work I set my alarm for 8 am, put it on the charger, which is behind the bed, and went to sleep... no big deal. I woke up to that 8 am alarm and then fell back asleep for somewhere between 10 seconds and 5 minutes. I woke up again to my alarm still blaring. Like every other morning I went to turn my body to grab my phone and turn it off. Well, at the same time my girlfriend decided to do me a favor by turning it off for me (without saying anything). Her rising head connected with my swinging elbow, and what resulted sounded like a baseball bat being broken. Cue a crying girlfriend, a frantic boyfriend, and a wonderful way to start to the day.
TL;DR:
