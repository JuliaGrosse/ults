TITLE: How to do approach a random stranger with the intent of forming a friendship and/or relationship?
POST: This sounds like a much more socially inept question than I hope it is, but I'm a bit at a loss here. Normally I think I do pretty well with making friends, asking girls out, etc, but I'm hitting a road block here. There's this girl in a class I have only once a week whom seems a lot like someone I would want to be friends with, and is pretty damn cute to boot, so I certainly wouldn't mind more either. 

The problem is, the class doesn't really have any opportunities for socialization, so I'm a bit unsure how to just go up and strike up a conversation out of the blue. I want to approach her more in in a friendly way rather than asking out on a date, because honestly I'd be totally content to just have her in my life as a friend. I know she knows my name, which actually surprised me since I hadn't told her or ever really introduced myself and I don't know how she managed to figure it out. Hopefully that means she's taken an interest in me as well. So how the hell do I approach her under this context? I don't want to seem weird and like I'm trying too hard, but this is a short class that I don't have often, so wasting time wont work. We're both 20ish and in college (obviously).
TL;DR:
