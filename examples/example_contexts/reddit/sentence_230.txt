TITLE: Why tracking is beautiful
POST: Hello beautiful souls of loseit!
Long time lurker, finally decided to get serious about losing the last 15. I've been at 150 for three years. Years of gradual lifestyle changes have gotten me down here. I started counting calories a few weeks ago. I realized the importance of a scale and have one  coming in the mail. I've just been wingin' it and have still seen results even with approximations. I overcompensate a little to make up for the lack of more accurate measurements. 
So today I sat around all day, and munched quite a bit. No real meals...a little of this..a little of that...I felt very much like eff it-I don't have the scale yet so how accurate can I really be until then?  Right now I'm laying in bed cruising Reddit, thinking about making PB (keto friendly)cookies. I'm not hungry but I'm definitely bored and already feel like I failed for the day. I'm mad at myself, sad I'll never get the body I want and overall feeling very discouraged. 

You know what? I said to myself, so many people have emphasized the importance of tracking even when you have a bad day. So I got onto MFP and logged everything. I ate more packaged food/carbs today than usual which is probably why I'm feeling so full. 
Anyways, I logged everything...and I'm still 100 cals under my daily allotment. Even with whatever inaccuracy there may be without a scale, it's not nearly as awful as I thought today was. So instead of sitting in bed feeling like a fattie and making cookies to'make me feel better' I owned up to what I ate. Now, I'm stoked and I don't want or need those cookies! 

It made me realize how I use food to hurt or punish myself. I was feeling like crap about myself and was just going to eat more. How is that productive?
TL;DR:
