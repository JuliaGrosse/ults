TITLE: Reddit, what is the weirdest phone call you have ever received?
POST: Mine happened about 45 minutes ago.  A guy that I was stationed with in the Navy, in Hawaii, 7 years ago called me.  I've kept the same cell phone number for the past ten years or so, so it's not completely crazy that someone would still have it.  The first words out of his mouth were not "Hey!  How have you been?!" but rather, "Hey, uh, I was stationed with you, remember? Well, I need sixty dollars or I'm going to jail for six months."  

  He then went on to tell me that he had been involved in a hit and run and leaving the scene, and that he was sixty dollars away from coming up with all of the cash that he needed for the fines.

I'm a nice person and all, but geez, seven years and the first time you contact me is to tell me a sob story about going to jail!  I should probably mention that he has a pretty bad Oxy habit that he started while he was in the Navy, and sounded ridiculously strung out on the phone.  So, not to surprising I guess.  

  I told him that I didn't have any money to lend him and he hung up quickly.
TL;DR:
