TITLE: advice on 'trusting' verbal Offer while Waiting for Paperwork via email
POST: Hey all - looking for advice on how long to wait for official paperwork to be emailed? 

My situation: Interviewed with CEO and another executive with company. Received a phone call Friday after hours from the executive who said I got the job and paperwork would be coming this week. I have to put in my two weeks at my current job, and they understand that my start date will be the 19th. 

However - I don't want to put in my two weeks until the offer is signed, sealed, delivered in writing. Still waiting on the offer via email. 

Am just looking for advice on how to handle this situation? Should I call them/email them just highlighting my scenario about putting in two weeks respectfully? 

Am just very worried this verbal offer will be rescinded or revoked because I'm overanalyzing this situation over and over. No background checks or anything required for this job.
TL;DR:
