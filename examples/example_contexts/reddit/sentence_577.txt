SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: What's the best/most memorable wedding you've ever been to, and why?
POST: I'm helping my best friend plan her wedding. Never planned anything like a wedding before. I was hoping there would be a /r/weddingporn subreddit like /r/foodporn and /r/roomporn, but I can't find anything like that. So I thought I'd ask the hive mind: what was the most memorable wedding you've ever been to, and why? 

I'm looking for inspiration and hoping your stories give me ideas. My friend isn't religious, but she's into the idea of incorporating cool wedding customs from other cultures/religions/etc., if we can make them meaningful to her.

Obviously she's on a budget and not hiring a real wedding planner, but I would still love to hear stories about crazy, outrageous, big weddings because we might be able to figure out ways to do smaller versions of bigger ideas.
TL;DR:
