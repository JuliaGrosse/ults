TITLE: Ex-girlfriend(17/F) Wants Me(18/M) Back After Having Sex with Another Man(18/M).
POST: So my girlfriend and I broke up after being in a relationship after a year and a month because we never saw eye-to-eye on anything.

 It was more one-sided with me breaking up with her because I became increasingly unhappy.

After a week we got back together but it only lasted for two weeks afterwards because there was no change.

 But I eventually grew obsessed with trying to get her back because I only broke up with her the second time because she stood me up twice on two dates.

Flash forward four months later she suddenly wants me back.

 After sitting down and talking we ended up making out and having sex. She eventually tells me the bad news:

She has had meaningless sex twice with one of her co-workers.

 She said it mean't nothing to her but it happened twice.

I didn't have sex with anyone except her and we lost our virginitys to each other so when she had sex with someone else it came to a massive shock.

I don't know if I want to take her back, I'm so conflicted because I still love her but knowing that she had sex with someone else twice really makes me rethink what I want.

I feel as if I have meaningless sex with someone else I might forgive her, but that's just immature to do.
TL;DR:
