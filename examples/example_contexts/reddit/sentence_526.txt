TITLE: Did I ruin my relationship by having sex too soon?
POST: Okay, so my boyfriend (18m) and I(17f) have been going out for three months.  I took his virginity about two months into the relationship.  We are very comfortable with each other, and he first told me he loved me two and a half weeks into the relationship (to be fair, we had been into each other for a really long time but the circumstances were never right until recently).  

Anyways, I worry he's losing interest in me.  He hardly texts back now and I feel like I bore him when we hang out.  Because of his detachment I become clingy, which makes the situation worse.  But he still tells me he loves me every night as he wishes me goodnight and does cute things...

We moved fast physically compared to my previous two year relationship, but we both are very comfortable with it.  I feel like we moved too fast though, upon retrospect, even though I love our closeness now.  Should I suggest a hiatus to all sexual activity for a few weeks, let us bond more emotionally?  The only thing is I really like the emotional and physical closeness/satisfaction post-coital.
TL;DR:
