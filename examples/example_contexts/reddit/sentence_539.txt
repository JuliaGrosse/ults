TITLE: Me [17 M] with my girlfriend [18 F] have been dating for nearly a year, need help with the future
POST: My girlfriend will be graduating this year entering a university 20-25 minutes away from where I live. Before we met, she had issues of "two-timing" or being attracted to two different people at once because it was easier, but then she transitioned to an all-girl schools. Now she'll be going to a big university and will be meeting and making new friends. 

I trust in her and want to believe that she won't fall for other guys or cheat in me. I talked to her yesterday about this and we realized that it would be hard for both of us but she wants us to still be together and says that she still loves me dearly and does not want to disappoint (cheat on) me. She told me that easily succumbs to peer pressure and is scared of making a mistake that she would regret because she says that she knows it would never be worth it. 

My question to all of you is how do I prevent this from happening? How do I make sure that she doesn't forget it in the heat of the moment? I really do love her and want this to work out. 

Thank you.
