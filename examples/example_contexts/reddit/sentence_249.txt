TITLE: My religious parents aren't letting me go to prom and I have a partner of a year and a half. What should I do?
POST: I'd expect my life story to be peculiar but perhaps not so much on reddit. So for the past two years I've been secretly agnostic, pretending to pray and everything when I can/to keep up appearances. My parents are (although somewhat liberal) quite religious muslims. I've also kept my SO a secret from them of course. 

I told them I want to go to prom "with the guys" but they said they were afraid of what I'd see and hear and that I don't need any sins, so they don't want me going. Yeah. I asked twice and I've had the same response.

I'm not that bothered about not going myself as I've never been a fan of large social atmospheres but my SO (as most typical teenage girls) is really excited to go. She's fully supportive of me, told me that she understands and that she'd go with the girls, but I can tell she's upset about it and is getting a tinge of jealousy when she sees her friends getting "promposals." Although she's never said or expressed anything negative to me, I'm a little upset at being the cause of her ruined prom experience, knowing how important it is to her. I feel really bad. What should I do?
TL;DR:
