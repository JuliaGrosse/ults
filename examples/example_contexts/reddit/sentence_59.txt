TITLE: Help with court procedures on speeding tickets
POST: So a few days I get pulled over for doing 46 in a 40 (end of the month quota time) and a ticket is issued. I get pretty lucky on these next parts. 

1.The ticket says 54 in a 40 so that is obviously different from what he told me.

2.From where I turned out at there isn't a speed limit sign for quite a ways up and going the opposite direction (which is the way I usually travel on this road if I do at all, was just picking up my boss that day) turn into 55 to start getting into highway traffic.

3.Went to go check for speed limit signs and the only one was spray painted out. (thank you random teenager!!!)

So how do I go about this now? Court date is the 20th. What questions should I ask the judge, should I even mention the officer told me the wrong speed? I feel like they'll take his word over mine even though I took notes of the conversation right afterwards. What about there not being a limit sign anywhere where I came off from?
TL;DR:
