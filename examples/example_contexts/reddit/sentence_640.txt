TITLE: TIFU by rubbing a leaf against a wall.
POST: It wasn't today but I mentioned it in a comment and some people wanted a story so here I go.

In high school one day I was waiting for my mom to pick me up because my car was in the shop, and while waiting I was really bored and picked up a leaf and was just fucking with it. At one point I rubbed it against a wall and some of the chlorophyll rubbed of and onto a the wall. I thought to my self "oh that's cool, I'm gonna make a square". A few seconds later, while I'm making my square the school cop runs up and grabs my arm and twists it behind my back and handcuffs me and throws me in his car, screaming at me while he does.

Luckily my mother was there to get me already and when the cop told her I was about to go to jail for rubbing a leaf against a wall, she demanded we see the principal first to tell her why that's stupid.

We told her the circumstances, and how I had no malicious intent, that it was just a guy being fascinated by something he learned at school 3 years ago, my principal said and I quote "well you may know that was chlorophyll but some of our less academic minded students will see that and think they can write on walls, that's why we have to suspend you for writing graffiti"
TL;DR:
