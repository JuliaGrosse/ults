TITLE: I [20 M] meet this girl [20 F] over spring break but now with spring break over we need to go separate ways. What do I do?
POST: Hey guys, over the spring break, I met this girl at a friend's party. We immediately clicked and spent hours talking and laughing. We went ahead and set up a date for the next day. Just a small date where we spent walking around downtown and sight seeing all her favorite places. I enjoyed every second of it and I could tell she did too. At the end of the day, I told her how much I enjoyed spending time with her and she said she did too. Before I left dropped her at her place, I had to tell her I was only here for a week and had to leave for school in a couple days. I could see she was saddened by it. I kissed her and dropped her off. Now I am laying in my bed wondering what I should do. It's funny how even though I only spent a day with her, I have never felt like that with any other girl. Don't want to sound like a dick but usually girls at parties or some attractive girls I know, I am only attracted to them sexually and nothing more but she was different. I don't know what I should do. I am afraid I might lose her if I don't make a move right now but I don't know if I should ask her to be my girlfriend since we have only been on one date and won't see each other until summer break. I don't know what to do. Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you.
