TITLE: 29/f want to end the relationship and move out, but feel bad because of a very expensive lease
POST: I've tried absolutely everything to fix my nearly 4 year relationship. I put myself into it entirely, but almost a year ago I realized it wasn't salvageable (at the core, we want different things). It completely broke my heart.

Now...I told my SO about a month ago that I'm not happy and haven't been for a long time. I didn't make any ultimatums, but I explained what was wrong and possible solutions. Nothing changed. As usual ambivalence prevailed. We aren't intimate in any way anymore and essentially live as roommates (but my SO still sees us as bf/gf and I haven't said anything "officially"). 

Where it becomes troubling: I was happy to ride this out until the (very) expensive lease on our apartment, then  break the bad news (about 6 months away.) Then, I meet a person I'm very interested in. I explained the situation, and they understood. But, now what? I refuse to date someone behind my SOs back just because they're apathetic and unresponsive in the relationship. Also, I can't just say "hey have fun making rent."

So now, I'm in a relationship I haven't been emotionally involved in for months. Met someone, but would feel too bad to just leave with all the bills.

I have no idea what to do.
TL;DR:
