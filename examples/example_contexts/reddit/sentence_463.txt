TITLE: I [23/F] am having a hard time forgiving my boyfriend [23/M] of 4months, for hitting on other girls online
POST: So I recently found that my boyfriend is hitting on other girls online, girls he's never met. He leaves comments like "wow you're too gorgeous" 

When I read it, my heart broke completely. He tells me he's so in love with me and I'm the love of his life, he even says he wants to marry me. If he felt that way about me I can't understand why he would tell other girls they're beautiful. I can't comprehend a legitimate reason. 

It hurts even more because he knows I have a lot of insecurities about my appearance and am very sensitive. It feels inappropriate and I'm finding it hard to forgive him despite his extensive apologies. 

Am I overreacting? I feel partly that I could be but he knows how hard it's been for me to give him my heart and trust, to accept his love for me.

Background of our relationship: we met online, live in other countries, fell madly in love and I took a 14 hour flight to meet him. We're working really hard to be together, I am moving to his country to be with him in Feb. We have a very passionate relationship, have worked through a lot and are very open and honest about everything. We believe it's true love but this whole situation has left me questioning everything.
TL;DR:
