TITLE: Me [23M] have 'creeped out' my fiance [23F] and don't know how to fix things.
POST: So my fiance [23F] of 3 years and I [M23] were recently at a dinner with some of her friends.
Among those friends was a friend to whom I'll refer as Belany.

Belany organized everything, and was essentially the hostess of the evening.

She has a habit of dressing, in the most polite of versions, scantily.

Now, being a Hank Hill of a male, it made me very uncomfortable and self conscious to be sitting at the same table as Belany. I did my best to be as sociable and polite as possible throughout the dinner, despite my discomfort.

After we left the dinner, I confessed to my fiance that I was very uncomfortable throughout the dinner due to Belany's attire. I told her how I did my best not to let my discomfort either show or ruin the dinner for anybody. 'Was I OK throughout dinner, my love?'

Before I know it, my fiance has used her superior knowledge and understanding of the English Language to convince me that I'm a creep, that I'm somehow sexually in love with Belany, and that I have bad hair to boot. She behaved as if I had, to a lesser degree, cheated on her.
Just to be clear, I'm a one-woman man. I'll remove my own manhood before I ever do anything unfaithful towards my future wife.

Am I a bad person? I certainly didn't think so, but the way my fiance received the news that I was uncomfortable during dinner, you'd think I just left her and our first born child to go play the slots in Vegas.
What's the best way to handle this?
TL;DR:
