TITLE: I [20 M] am quiet by nature. Do I have to change to meet someone?
POST: I don't say a lot even among friends. The only person I've felt comfortable engaging in enthusiastic conversation with is my brother.
I am a good listener and enjoy hearing what people have to say and I will answer questions just briefly. I tend to show friendliness through favors, helping out, paying for stuff without asking for money back, that sort of stuff.

However I'm not good at making new friends because I'm not a good conversationalist. And I've never even been on a date because I'm not good at talking to girls. I've been trying to get a date for the 2 years I've been in college and I haven't had a luck because it's against my nature to engage someone in conversation.

Do I have to change the way I am to meet people (hopefully girls) or is there some way to play to my strengths and weaknesses?
TL;DR:
