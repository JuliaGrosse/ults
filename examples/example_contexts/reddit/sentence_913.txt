TITLE: She [23 F] asked me if I wanted a ride [26 M], am I overthinking it?
POST: There's this girl at my church who I really like, I don't think I've ever really been too forward about it all that much, but knowing me, maybe she knows already, or has kind of guessed it.

Anyways, I go to Bible Study with my dad every week. Sometimes I pick him up from his house, sometimes he picks me up from mine, makes it easier on gas that way. Last week once it ended, I went out to my car and waited for my dad to finish up putting the microphones away. I was just sitting on the hood/front bumper looking at the stars when she leaves as well. Out of the blue she just asked me if I needed a ride home, and I said I'm okay, but thanks for asking. It would've been out of her way to give me a ride too.

When I got home I was wondering about the situation, and I don't know if I'm overthinking this, but I was baffled by why she asked me. I was there for one thing, so I obviously had a means to get there and if I didn't have a way to get home it wouldn't make sense for me to go in the first place, not to mention I was sitting on the hood. 

I want to ask her out on a date, but could I maybe take this as a sign that she's interested in me, or at least trusts me? I know myself personally I wouldn't offer a ride to someone (especially one where I'd be going out of my way to do so) I don't trust or feel comfortable with. If any women are reading this, would you offer a ride to a guy who is mostly an acquaintance to you?
TL;DR:
