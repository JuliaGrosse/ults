TITLE: I feel like my 17 year old cousin was the victim of a child predator and I don't know what to do (if anything)
POST: My cousin, who is 17 now, met his girlfriend and started dating a little over a year ago. Last week while out to dinner with their parents, his girlfriend's mom said to her daughter "Isn't it funny how our little plan worked?" My aunt is like "...uh what plan?". Well apparently this girl's mother saw a picture of my cousin on facebook playing sports and on the homecoming court. Since her daughter was going to be a new student at the same school as my cousin, she told her to find him on the first day of school and "make him your boyfriend". At that point, my cousin had never had a girlfriend or gotten much attention from girls then all of a sudden he had this cute blond cheerleader following him around. So obviously, he was hyped.

When I was told this story, I wanted to find this woman and wring her neck. Especially now that my cousin is completely wrapped around his girlfriend's finger, not going to the college he got a FULL RIDE SCHOLARSHIP to so he can stay home with her and talking about moving into her parent's house with her. 

I guess I just needed to rant, I doubt there's anything to be done. I just feel like I'm watching a bad movie.
TL;DR:
