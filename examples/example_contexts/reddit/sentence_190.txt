TITLE: I [25M] am slipping into old patterns with a long term friend and crush [24F]. Am I making the wrong call?
POST: I met this girl, years ago on new year's eve. We hit it off. This is one of those few you meet whom you compare all the rest to. Went on some unsuccessful dates, I'd just come out of a big relationship, and hadn't really processed properly, and things slowly fell apart. We had some minor issues, but it was mostly bad timing and poor assumptions.

Four years later now, we have been on again off again friends, and recently have fallen back into a pattern of long emails, sometimes several times a day, and hang out more and more often. We talk for ten hours without noticing the time go by, and we are extremely comfortable with one another.

She has had a long term romantic entanglement with a highschool sweetheart, and has only this year really moved away from it. Now I see more of her, she is again more liable for physical contact, and is sweeter than ever.

She is quite an introspective person and at the best of times liable to conceal her true feelings, she has her reasons, and I don't fault her for them, but this also constantly leaves things in a state of confusion. We're friends, but most of my female friendships don't extend to this level of intimacy, and the ones that do have clear boundaries.

This is why I'm confused. I understand that many of these things are normal for friendships, buy I can never shake the feeling we have a connection. Am I being mislead, am I simply blind, is she just trying to be my friend and I'm hopelessly complicating the situation? I can't tell anymore, and I can't really seek clarity with her because those kind of conversations are like smoking on a powder keg, and at the end of the day, I don't a row.
TL;DR:
