SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I (22/f) still find my mind wandering to my ex (33/m) sometimes. Does this happen to anyone else?
POST: I'll try to keep this short. It's been over three since things ended with my ex. I've been with my current boyfriend (m/22) for about 2.5 years and everything is really awesome! So this isn't an issue of going back to my ex or whatever but I was just wondering if anyone else out there still thinks about their ex sometimes even after so long. 

Background story. I was a senior in high school when it started and a first year in college when we ended things. The relationship lasted around 7/8 months and it was my first serious, "I love you," kind of relationship. The way things ended were very dramatically and traumatically. I made stupid decisions and was naively led into thinking that being with him was wonderful and it was cool to have someone so much older like me (yes, stupid I know). My family life has been really horrible for many years; both parents are very emotionally and physically abusive so I clung to him for the attention and support. The only other person I had was my sister (she and I have always been extremely close) and she saved me from wanting to kill myself when my parents attacked me after finding out about the guy and forcing me to end it with him.

I guess my question is, does anyone still think about their exs sometimes? I know that I don't love him anymore and wouldn't ever consider getting together with him even if I were single or whatever but I think the experience was so ingrained in my head that it lingers on. I'm guessing it'll eventually stop coming to my head but yeah... any experience?
TL;DR:
