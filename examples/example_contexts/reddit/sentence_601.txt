TITLE: TIFU by asking a teacher for an extra 0.37 points
POST: So, the first semester just ended at my school, and in one of my classes I was 0.37 points away from getting an A. This is equal to 0.05%. I sent an email to the teacher yesterday explaining the situation, and asking if she would be nice enough to grant me the extra points. She responded with a very cryptic "Students earn grades, teachers don't give them". This morning, I went in to talk to her again, and try to get the points. What I didn't know was that she had had a very strenuous chemotherapy treatment the previous day. She appeared very stressed, and when I asked her again she went off on a rant. In this rant she accused me of being a sexist and trying to take advantage of her because she was female, told me that I wasn't an A student, didn't put effort into anything in my life, and threatened to rescind some of the recommendations she had written for me, and not write anymore recommendations for me.
TL;DR:
