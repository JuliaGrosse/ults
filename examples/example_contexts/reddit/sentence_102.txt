SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [21 M] have been interested in this girl [18 F] on my work since last year and we talk a lot but I am not sure if she is interested.
POST: So it all started last summer when we met at work and she was this girl I did not notice to much since she is not that kind of person who you just notice at first.

Anyways we talk sporadically during work and under the summer through facebook sometimes but I never got the vibe she was super interested since I had to start all conversations so I kinda dropped it. 

Now during spring we started talking, **a lot**. We added each other on snapchat and we basically write everyday through snap or chat and I am definetly interested. I even got the balls to just ask her if she wanted to go eat and catch a movie or something and she said yes!

We are gonna se each other next week but I am that kind of person who still don't feel good about it. Never been in a realtionship before and I can't understand signs from girls, if I ever get them and I am not sure if she likes me back or not. I am not even sure how to handle this "dating" thing we might get going and what to do.

I am probably overthinking this and it might be obvious but I just need some output by others so what do you think? If you want more details I can add no problem.
TL;DR:
