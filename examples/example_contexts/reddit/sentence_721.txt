TITLE: Today something doesn't seem right about my (19M) girlfriend (20F) of 4 months.
POST: My girlfriend and I have recently (temporarily) moved apart from each other, but we still talk every day.

Two days ago, my girlfriend was working back-to-back shifts - one at night, and one the next morning. She said she would have time to talk to me the following day, after her shift.

The next day I don't hear from her until almost 10PM, and I'm about to go to sleep. So we don't have much of a conversation, and I just expressed that I was disappointed that we didn't have time to talk. Stuff happens, I guess.

Then at 4AM, I get a drunk knocking on my door, so I call the police to come deal with him, and check my phone after he's taken care of, and see a couple missed texts from my girlfriend at around 1:30AM asking if I'm mad and if I want to Skype with her later today, so I shoot her a text, thinking she'll see it when she wakes up today. 

But she immediately responded, which surprised me. I ask why she's up in a joking way, and she said she was with her friends. In her small town nothing is open at 4AM, so when I ask her where she is, she says she's at a guy's house. But it's okay because he's gay. And he's just drunk anyway ^hehe. And also there aren't "friends" there, just the two of them because 3 other people conveniently left in the 15 minutes it took her to text that. And she's still there now (4:45AM).

This situation makes me feel really uncomfortable, most likely due to being cheated on by two different partners in the past and this situation resembling one of the instances fairly closely. Am I paranoid? What can I do? What should I say to my girlfriend?
TL;DR:
