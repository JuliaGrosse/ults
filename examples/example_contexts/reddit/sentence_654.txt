TITLE: 19/m] I fucked up Christmas and my girlfriend [19/f] is really upset at me and I don't know what to do
POST: My girlfriend and I got into a fight at her house, she pulled my hair and I asked her not to put her hands on me like that and then she slapped me, so I pushed her and she fell back into a shelf, and her parents rushed in and her dad punched me in the face, and then I was moved from the house to the yard where I was talked to by her dad, and they gathered all of my things and gave them to me and her dad took me home. She hasn't talked to me since I left and I am going crazy, I love this girl more than life itself and I want to be with her more than anything. This was the first time anything was physical between us and now I don't know what to do. She removed our relationship from facebook and it says single now and I don't know what to do. Everyone is telling me that I should just give it time and it will be ok, i've left her a bunch of messages and voicemails yet no response. So Reddit, please help me
