TITLE: Feeling like my depression makes me [25/F] a terrible wife to my wonderful husband [25 M/]. Advice?
POST: I've been with my husband since ninth grade (almost eleven years). I have always suffered from chronic depression and he has always been an unwavering support for me during the tough times. He is so kind about it but I feel insanely guilty that he has to deal with it constantly. I have constant panic attacks and mood swings and I haven't been able to control it at all recently. He is a saint. The least I could do is give him some good sex. 

Unfortunately, my sex drive is at an all time low. I don't want it at all and I honestly feel like I don't need it ever. I've switched medications in an attempt to revive it but I fear that I'll never get it back at this point. He is so patient about it but I fear that he'll start to think I'm not attracted to him or I don't love him. And mostly I fear that I'm depriving him of sex, which is terrible! He is probably incredibly stressed out about my problems and he needs an outlet that I can't provide right now. I feel like the worst wife ever :(

I want to be able to show him how much I love him and how much I appreciate all of his help. I just started seeing a psychiatrist in the hopes that she'll be able to help me with it. The medications make me robotic but without them I'm constantly on the verge of insanity. 

I know he says he doesn't mind but I feel so guilty and selfish. He has to work around my problems all the time. He doesn't deserve that and I don't really know how to proceed. 

Has anyone else been through this? Have you been able to overcome the lacking sex drive that comes with depression and antidepressants? How can I improve my sex drive? How can I show my appreciation in other ways?
TL;DR:
