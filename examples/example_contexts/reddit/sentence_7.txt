TITLE: I [19 F] found the guy my friend is dating [22M, 19 F] on Tinder
POST: As the title says, I found the guy my friend is dating on Tinder, and he was active one day ago. They've been dating for more than a month now (maybe 2 months?). Since they're not exclusive, normally I wouldn't tell my friend but I know that she wants to become exclusive with him, and he took her virginity. My friend also really, really likes this guy. I think it would crush her if she knew. 

Should I tell her? It's also the week before finals and she's very stressed studying for her final exams and papers. In the meantime I have taken a screen shot of the evidence. I was planning on telling her after finals are all over...

Thanks!
