TITLE: Want to tell my girlfriend [18] I'm[16] uncomfortable with her hanging out with her exes.
POST: So, my girlfriend have been going out for about 8 months, and it's been by far the best relationship I've ever been involved in. In fact it's been the only relationship I've been involved in, so I have no idea what I'm doing. First of all, should I even tell her how I feel about it? Or am I just going to come off a way to clingy and controlling? I mean, just today she went out and had ice cream with one of her exes that she went out with for around a year and a half. She is heading off to university about a week from now, and she invited a different ex and it might just me being paranoid, but I swear they disappeared together for a little bit. Also, one of her best friends is a guy, and I saw a text that he sent her once, telling her about how he would drop everything for her if she even showed the slightest interest in going out. Any advice I could get would be very useful.
TL;DR:
