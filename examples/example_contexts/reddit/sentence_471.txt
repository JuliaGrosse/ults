TITLE: Me [21 M] with my girlfriend[18 F] of 3 months, she threatens to hurt herself and doesn't understand why I don't want to be in a relationship
POST: Okay so I'll start with the problem. I don't want to be in a relationship and my girlfriend doesn't understand. She claims she's only happy when she's with me, would do anything for me, and so on. Whenever I want to break up, she says that it hurts her so much and she wants to relieve the pain by hurting herself.
I hate to see her like this so I get back with her.
I care about her, I am close to her but I don't want a relationship because of some personal issues.

I have very sociopathic traits, as told by a few of my friends. Deep down, I don't care about people as in I can move on from them easily. I can replace people in my life easily. I don't think I can fall in love or love anyone the traditional way. I don't manipulate people though, I really want others to be happy, but I just simply don't get attached or miss anyone (same with family) even though I can be sociable and get close to people. 

She doesn't understand this at all. She claims I'm putting up my walls and I'm stopping myself from loving people. Maybe, maybe not, I see a therapist for this. She thinks she can change me, but I don't think so. There was a post on reddit I saw that describes how I feel. 

What do I do? I know I'll never love her the way she wants me to. I'll eventually get bored and sick of getting back with her and that's the point where I move on and not care about what she thinks....
TL;DR:
