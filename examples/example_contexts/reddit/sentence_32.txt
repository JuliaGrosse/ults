TITLE: Going to this Uni's counselor, I need some help...
POST: I have been studying for the SATs for several months now because I plan on taking the test on May 4th. The University that I am planning on going to is Kean University and I am going to see the counselor; although, I have some idea as what to ask I would like to know what you (College veteran, people who has gone through this whole college process already) think I should make an imperative to ask. I want to major in Economics so if any of you who is or has studied Economics would like to give me advice as to what I should ask concerning this major so that I fully knowledgeable on the matter.
I will be eternally grateful.
TL;DR:
