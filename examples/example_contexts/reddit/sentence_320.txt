SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Hey, r/relationships. I [F20] am American, born and raised. My Indian-American SO [M23] of two and a half years officially "outed" me to his parents. I could use some advice.
POST: To give the long-story short, SO's parents have known he's had a girlfriend for quite some time, but have chosen to ignore it (either thinking it wasn't serious, or that it would end and he would move on). A few days ago, he decided to "out" me to his parents, and spent several hours making his case and defending me. His parents came to the consensus that they would *consider* meeting me. Boyfriend said he gives his parents a month until they cave and want to meet me.

My SO and I are rather serious, and while we are still a way's off, we've discussed marriage in the future. So, obviously, it is very important to me that when I meet his parents, I want to make as good a impression on them as possible. They have fears and trepidations about their son being in a relationship with someone that was not born and raised in their culture, and had put up a fight about it.

Although born in India, my SO spent almost his entire life living and growing up in the states. He easily identifies as American with regards to his Indian (Gujarati) heritage.

Does anyone have any advice or perspectives to share? Is there anything that I can do personally (besides the obvious, like continuing to be a good girlfriend) to make this whole process of meeting his parents and --hopefully-- getting along with them easier? I ask my boyfriend plenty of questions about cultural things to keep in mind, do's and don'ts, but I can only nag him so much. He remains absolutely certain that they're going to love me when they meet me.
TL;DR:
