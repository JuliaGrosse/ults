TITLE: [21F] Friend [22F] is Abusive to her BF [22M] and it Pisses Me Off
POST: One of my close friends has been dating this guy for like 6 months, she treats him poorly and it bothers me. She talks to him in a really condescending way and she's really demanding, she expects him to do every single thing for her, and she's slapped him several times. And that's just that I've seen, I'm sure she's done it more when I'm not around, and maybe even worse than slapping. I'm a really caring person, probably almost to a detriment, so I'm quite concerned and I have talked to him once before about their relationship and how she treats him. And she found out about that and got pissed at me, accusing me of trying to get him to cheat on her with me and stuff. I want to talk to my friend about it too, maybe she doesn't realize what she's doing? I feel really intimidated by her though and I don't know how to talk to her about it because she'll get defensive and start saying I'm insulting her or something.
TL;DR:
