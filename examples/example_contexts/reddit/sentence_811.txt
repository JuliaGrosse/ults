TITLE: My gf (18) and I (M23) have just talked about the idea of a threesome, wat do.
POST: We have been together for 1 year.

We basically entertained the idea of her making out with a girl (mutually), To discussing well we can't just bring a girl over and have her leave for us to have sex to, let me ask this girl if she wants to. 

The girl that she asked initially said yes but now the next day is having doubts but hasn't said no. The girl in question is a good friend of hers so I'm assuming it's somebody she's comfortable with.

Now I've never done this before so I have no idea where to start. But how do I approach the situation and let her know about somebody I might have in mind. I would want this someone to focus on her mainly so she doesn't think that I just want to have sex with other woman. 

I told her from the start if she is any way uncomfortable with this then we don't have to go through with it because I cherish our relationship more than a threesome.
TL;DR:
