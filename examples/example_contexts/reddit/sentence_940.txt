SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: When were you rewarded for your actions and what was the reward? I'll start...
POST: So a month ago I felt like promoting [Josh Cooley] a hilarious and talented Pixar storyboard artist/voice actor. I submitted two imgur albums of his work, [this one] and [this one] which got really big, really fast.

Since they got so big, and since he hadn't blogged for over a year, I worried that he might not have wanted the attention; maybe he was way too busy making amazing Pixar stuff and had no time to worry about his side business, and just maybe didn't want the attention. 

So, I emailed him and told him I could take it all down. [This was his awesome response.](

That settled that! I emailed him back with my name and address and I just yesterday got the SIGNED book for free! Here's the thrilling unboxing and, admittedly, awesome pics of the book, for those of you who really have nothing better to do: [Unboxing] and [awesome detail pics of hilarity] (there's a lot more all throughout)

Anyways, because of all the attention he got (about 15 million views), people were throwing money at the screen to buy his artwork and all his sales increased, hooray!

In the end, he was happy, I was happy, and I'd like to think that Reddit was happy, too :)

I really think Reddit is a force for the good and positive, which can really impact the lives of our local or favorite, unknown artists.
