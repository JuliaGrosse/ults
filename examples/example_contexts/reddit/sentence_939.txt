TITLE: Overly excited dog when outside, or around people/dogs
POST: Hi guys!

Me and my girlfriend have a 1 year old female Cairn terrier. She knows basic obedience commands (sit, stay, come, heel, etc.) and does these commands pretty well when we are inside our apartment.

The problem comes when we take her outside to go to the bathroom or to take a walk. There are plenty of people / animals around our apartment and she gets crazy excited when she sees anyone. If there is no one outside she does decently well, but still isn't very responsive to our commands. 

We've tried taking her favorite toys and her favorite treats, but she still is not interested in them. The only way we can get her to get a little bit of focus on us is to completely leave the situation with her.
TL;DR:
