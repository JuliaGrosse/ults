SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I'm [20 M] am finally seeing some success with women, but don't know what to do with it.
POST: First, I just want to say that I'm not secretly bragging, here. I've been working hard to improve myself for the past year in terms of dating. I've been working out, dressing better, and I've been putting myself out there enough that I've become a lot less awkward socially as I've gained more experience. 

Because I was so crappy with women before, I followed the typical pick up artist advice of just hitting on every hot girl I met. The rationale is that most of these women are going to flake out or say no to you, but the ones who like you will say yes. So if you ask out 10-15 women you think are cute, you'll find one or two that think you're great as well and you can just go from there. 

Lately though, I've been hearing a lot more yes than no. And I don't know what the hell do to. All these women want different things from me, and I'm not sure which route to pick. Some women just want to hook up, some want to date.I'm afraid if I don't hook up with these women, I'll regret it and miss my chance. But is it really ethical to hook up with multiple women in a short period? How would I know if I were spreading STDs? Even if I'm safe, I'll never be sure. Then I'm also afraid that I'll miss out on someone great in a real relationship because I'm too busy having shallow flings.
TL;DR:
