TITLE: Travel Advice Needed From Dog Owning Travelers
POST: I originally posted this in /r/dogs but I thought this sub might be a better place for it. My question is: My girlfriend and I are hoping to adopt a dog next summer. Both of us have wanted to get a dog for many years now and next year we will finally have the opportunity to do so. However, both of us also love to travel and would like to spend some time in Southeast Asia/Australia/South America, before we get too old to do some of the more physically demanding things that we enjoy. We aren't the type of people who would feel right just dumping our dog on a sitter for a couple of weeks/months. So our question is basically what are our options? Does anybody have any experience traveling abroad with their dogs (particularly in less developed countries)? What options worked for you? How did you find dog friendly airlines/hotels/campgrounds/places to visit? How did you negotiate various culture's views on dogs as pets?

All we have been able to come up with so far is that we either choose traveling or we choose the dog. I feel like there has to be some sort of middle ground here.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!
