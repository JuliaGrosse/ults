TITLE: Since the arrival of a new dog, our older dog pees everywhere. Help?
POST: We have two dogs. One is seven, the other is one. Since the arrival of the younger pup, our older dog has decided he wants to mark his territory and has been peeing inside on all the furniture multiple times per day. We have never had this problem before... Training him as a puppy was effortless.     
      
Now none of our methods are effective. No matter what we do, he finds a way to pee inside. Even if we watch him like a hawk in the room, he'll straight up pee in front of us.     
    
He is not neutered, and the vet has told us this is our only hope in terms of making the accidents go away. We aren't really comfortable with doing this to him now that he's older, so as it stands, it's our last resort.     
     
Suggestions would be amazing! Anybody experience the same problem? Thanks!
