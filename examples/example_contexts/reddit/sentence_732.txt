TITLE: My boyfriend [25m] won't brush his damned teeth. I'm [22f]
POST: My boyfriend just doesn't care about brushing his teeth. His teeth are rotting, he has several cavities. And his breath is horrid in the morning, more than the average persons. I refuse to kiss him when his breath is like that and it hurts his feelings. But it tastes so gross. I havve told him why i hate it, and i asked him how would he feel if he could taste what seems like vomit in my mouth every time he kissed me. I have to pester him and basically be a mom to him until he brushes his teeth. If I'm lucky i can get him to do it once a day several hours after waking up.

He didnt used to be like this but depression + not taking care of yourself will sometimes have tis effect on people and their teeth. I get it. But goddamn it, I want to be able to kiss him and not feel sick. 

Just last night i told him to brush his teeth before bed, but he had already laid down and said "But I'm comfortable. I can do it tomorrow." When he woke up, his breath was horrid as usual and i asked him to brush his teeth. He said sure but was trying to snuggle and his face was near me and his breath is just dreadful. I covered up his mouth with the blanket, he turned over and started pouting, saying i was being mean, and went back to sleep after ignoring me.

Im tired of this. His has tooth decay and i just want him to at least brush his teeth since his work makes it difficult for him to get to a dentist. Im not sure what im looking for here. I just want some assurance that I'm not being unreasonable here. He doesn't get that I hate the smell and I do not like kissing him when his breath is bad and it tastes like shit. I love him dearly. This is literally the only complaint I have.
