TITLE: [17/f] I caught my brother [16/m] in my room wearing my clothes, he confesses to me that he has always been gay and wants to be a girl, how can I support him further?
POST: About 2 weeks ago, I came home one day from school earlier than usual because my teacher let us go early, and when I got home, I heard moaning noises in my bedroom.
Right there and then I thought things aren't gonna be good, I found my brother masturbating while wearing my panties, clothes and heels. Immediately shit turns awkward and at first I was creeped out like no tomorrow. But we sat down and he begged me to hear him out. He basically came out saying he is gay or bi but he doesn't know? His exact words were "I want to become a pretty girl like you sis". I kind of understood that my brother has been hiding all this and him finally coming out made me a bit happy and I want to support him 100%. Obviously he didn't tell anyone else, and our parents are honestly the biggest obstacle because they are the strict Asian types (we are 2nd generation Viet). So my brother has never told anyone until now. I want to help him and support him, so I promised him that I'll lend him some of my clothes and undies and even help him buy feminine stuff for him. I don't really know what else I could do for him considering our parents will likely kick him out of the house if they found out about his sexual orientation. I want to be the best big sister and be there for him, ever since he came out (about 2 weeks ago) we started hanging out more and connecting on a more personal level. At night when our parents are asleep he would just sneak over and we would have "girl talk" and play dress up, I know it might sound weird but it makes him happy and I am happy for him too, knowing that the only time he can be himself is with me. How can I help him further, I know its hard for him to hide it and he just seems to enjoy life so much more whenever hes in my room being himself?
TL;DR:
