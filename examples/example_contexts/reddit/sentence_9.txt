TITLE: Me [28F] with my ex [27F] of 5 years, wants to know about my status but won't ask.
POST: We broke up in June over text then made it official in Sept of this year. We broke up because of long distance after college opportunities separated us.

Now that we are in a transitional phase of our lives we still text (only) about what we are doing and what is next in our lives. Well I have gone out of state to be with family and friends considering it is the holiday season. 

When I tell her I am hanging out with a friend she always jump the gun and thinks I am seeing someone special. In her round about way she has told me that if I am seeing someone that she won't text me anymore. 

Also, for some odd reason she chooses not to communicate via phone, Skype, or in person. We have met twice in person and both visits ended well with a warm hug and great conversations. I'm not sure what is going on considering we still share two dogs, share a few accounts, and we both have not deleted the thousands of pictures we have.

I want to be with her but I feel like we are too far apart and I guess I don't know what to think because I don't talk to anyone about it. Please be kind with your words/comments.

Thank you.
