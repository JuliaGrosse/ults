SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice
TITLE: Dispute with my landlord before moving in, need help!
POST: Hi, so I applied to move into a flat a while back, signed the lease, paid the deposit and application fee, and was just waiting on references. My bank (HSBC) took 4 weeks to produce one as initially they were only giving statements and were not producing the reference in the form the landlord wanted. They finally produced it this week and my landlord said i can move in on the weekend. However, he says that as it has taken 4 weeks, he wants me to share the cost of the rent for the past 4 weeks before I move in. Is this okay to do? He had not passed over they keys or allowed me to move in until the bank had produced the reference, which was held up on no fault of my own. He is refusing to allow me to pay rent from just my moving in day. Can I get some advice on whether he is being fair or if there is something I can do?! Thanks! (I live in the UK if that is relevant at all)
TL;DR:
