TITLE: A girl [19-ish F] is hitting on me [19 M] but I unfortunately don't like her back. How should I handle this?
POST: A girl who recently joined the club I'm in in college has gotten particularly close to me and I have good reason to believe she's hitting on me. I've hit on girls before and I know how I act when I am crushing on a girl, and it's not too different from the way she's acting around me. She's a really nice girl and I enjoy her company. However, I don't like her in *that* way. I've been on her side of things before and I know how it feels to try to get close to someone, and worse, I know how it feels to consider someone your friend only to find them removing you from their life when you confess your feelings to them. I know how it feels to walk five feet away from someone you once considered a good friend and they don't give you so much as a nod because you confessed your feelings to them and they shut you out, and I would hate to be that person. And we're in the same club anyway, so that would make things very awkward. But at the same time, I don't want lead her on because that happened to me before and it doesn't feel good when reality comes crashing down on you. It's a tricky situation.
TL;DR:
