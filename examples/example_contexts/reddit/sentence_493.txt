TITLE: TIFU by scratching a luxury car with a sports car.
POST: I am currently visiting my Aunt for a couple of days while I am traveling. She is very busy at the moment, so I'm hanging around her place playing with her dogs and enjoying the sun. 

As I'm leaving tonight, she suggested I drive her brand new Nissan z35. I was hesitant about it, as I haven't been driving for very long (roughly 8 months) and didn't feel all that confident. But then again, I'm leaving tonight and it'd be a shame to miss out on an opportunity to spend time together. So I agreed. 

Driving the car was easy enough; it was a bit 'jumpy' and didn't have great visibility, but other than that, it was okay. I pulled into the CBD and realized that parking was at a premium. I managed to find a spot on the main road. It looked pretty tight - but I really didn't have another alternative and I was already late. I remember my girlfriend telling me reversing in was easier for her, but I really didn't feel confident enough to back it in due to poor visibility. So I lined it up and swung it around and slowly rolled into a space between 2 parked cars - an Audi A4 to the left and some shitbox to the right. I slowly rolled in, until I heard a CHRRRRRERRRRZZZZ sound. I reversed out, but the damage was done. I left multiple scratches, about 30 cm in size, to the back left bumper of the Audi, but no dents. Oh, and my Aunt was watching it all from behind me. She was visibly pissed, but really cool about it - she doesn't want any of my money (which I also don't have, as I'm traveling).  Of course I will offer to pay her back - but I guarantee she won't accept it. The damage to the Nissan is minimal, barely visible - so it could have been worse. All in all, shit fucking day. I feel like an absolute dickhead for causing her more stress and financial damage. We had lunch after but I didn't eat much.
TL;DR:
