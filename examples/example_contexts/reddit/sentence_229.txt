TITLE: How long does it take to train for a marathon? (x-post from r/running)
POST: Hey Reddit, my dad's passion is Ironman races. He has done 4 and is gearing up for his 5th next year. He has just recieved horrible news today that the tendons in his knee have given out. The doctor told him that if he chooses to race next March, there is a large risk that in later life, his ability to walk will be severely hindered. He has decided not to race next year's [Melbourne Ironman] and not to run again for fear of losing the ability to have a functioning knee. Although there is an operation to fix it, the doctor's advice is that he still not run due to the risks.

I don't want my dad to have to forfeit his dream due to this. It is possible to race Ironman in teams. I am thinking about doing the marathon leg of the race, and leaving him the swim and ride. 

I need advice on how long it takes to gear up and train (properly) for the 42.2km run. Are 37 weeks adequate time to train from a point of nil fitness to a good, race standard?
TL;DR:
