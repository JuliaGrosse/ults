TITLE: I want to move into an apartment with some of my friends but have no idea how to convince my parents. What would/did you do/say?
POST: Dear Reddit, 

I am a 21-year old male who, along with two other friends, want to move into an apartment together. All three of us are still studying. One of us has already gotten permission from his parents. It would be hard but not impossible financially - I work in a pet store one day a week and me and one of my to-be roommates both study IT and there's always some way to earn money in that sector. If necessary, we also have a backup plan to earn some extra bucks that I'd rather not share here. Due to several reasons, I can't tell my parents about this. 

My main motivation for wanting to move out is the fact that my parents are moving far away from where I live now, making my daily commute to and from school (with public transport) a 2 hour one instead of a fifteen minute one, plus the added downside of leaving everyone and everything I know for a small village in the figurative middle of nowhere. They also keep telling me that I am not prepared for the real world and this, to me, would be a great way to learn how to function completely or almost completely autonomously in society. 

The problem is that I don't know how to convince my parents to let me go through with this. I'm inclined to do it anyway even if they don't want me to, just because I need a place where I can get away from them and it's impossible if I'm stranded kilometres from every place I know. What I would like to know most is how you would or did convince your parents to let you move out, as well as any advice for someone who's planning on moving out.
TL;DR:
