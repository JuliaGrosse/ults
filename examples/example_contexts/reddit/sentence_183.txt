TITLE: Reddit, I need some advice. I am in a tight spot.....
POST: So my issue is pretty complicated, and I need some advice. We made some crazy financial decisions when I still had a great job, but due to the economy I am now working at a call center for much less. My GF and I currently live in a small town in WV were we both work for $10 an hour (each). I have an opportunity to take a job in NYC for $60K in my field. We have very little money, we are behind on our bills, and I am not sure if we can even get even or out of the hole at our current pay. When I had my previous job these bills were easily paid, but now...... A breakdown:

We pay: 500 for rent 433 for Car #1 (11K left on loan) 328 for Car #2 (2.5K left on loan) 323 for insurance (Just turned 25) 200 for AT&T (iPhones) 250 for Electricity, Water, Heat 225 Student Loans 100 Internet Cable 19 Home Phone

Total Bills: $2378 (avg)

Our credit is screwed, we have moved 4 times in 1 year (not our fault, rentals being sold), and we have maybe $300 to our name.

So here is the question. Do we move to NYC for the new job? I can crash at a friends place for a month or two up there to save up the first few paychecks. Maybe find a place in Brooklyn for like $1,500, cut the iPhones off, cut the cable, get rid of the $433 a month car, pay off the $328 car and go to liability only. Or, do we stay here and just try to make it work, try and spend a year out of the field, and somehow catch up. I am so lost. Help!!!
