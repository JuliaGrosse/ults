TITLE: Meeting a fellow runner ruined my plan but turned out great
POST: Just wanted to share my experience from yesterday. 

I'm training for a HM in about 6 weeks and my schedule had a 2 hour long run for me on Sunday. I started nice and easy for the first hour, enjoying the run, the weather and the beautifull forest. After about an hour I came across a fellow runner on an intersection. We introduced ourselves to eachother and decided to run together in a second. Somehow it was just the natural and fun way to go. Hey, who are you? Shall we run together?.... Just as easy.  The next 45 minutes we ran together and I loved it. Just chatting an relaxing and sharing stories. Running way faster than my plan though, he was a lot more experienced than I was, therefore I left my run a bit short. 

I never run with other people, I like running alone without any distractions (no music etc). Just me, my breathing and my cadence. This experience was very good to step out of my comfort zone and relax a bit more about my plan. During the run together I never thought of my pace, my heartrate, my cadence... I just ran. Somehow I feel more relaxed now about my plan.
TL;DR:
