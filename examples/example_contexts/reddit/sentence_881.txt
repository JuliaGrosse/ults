TITLE: Me[22 M] with my two friends[22 F], one interfered in my friendship with the other
POST: So I am friends with Betsy and Robin. Betsy and Robin have been friends for longer than I have been with them and they always hang out. Robin and my friendship is slowly winding down.

Anyways, whenever I've asked Robin to hang out, it usually hasn't worked out. She says yes, then something comes up and then it's cancelled. I asked her to hang out on my birthday, she said yes then something came up. I was sad, definitely, but it wasn't unexpected.

However, Betsy was annoyed on my behalf. When Robin asked her to go to a party, Betsy asked her why she didn't invite me. I don't know what they said exactly, but Robin then invited me. 

Now I feel extremely embarrassed for Betsy's involvement. I feel that *Robin knows I exist* and whatever reasons she has for not inviting me or whatever flaky reasons she has for not coming to my invites is valid to her and it's way too confrontational to ask her why she doesn't really want to hang out with me. Also, I've hung out with Robin before a couple times.

I feel that it reflects badly on me that Betsy had to ask Robin to ask me to hang out. Like I asked or manipulated Betsy into getting Robin to ask me to come out. Also, Betsy doesn't know that what she's done has made it awkward for me. 

I just wonder, what should I do about this situation? Should I apologize to Robin about Betsy making it an issue? Should I just do nothing cause Robin and I don't really vibe anymore and it's just the end anyway?
