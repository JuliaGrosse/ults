TITLE: Need some advice on breaking up
POST: So I think it's time for my GF and I to call it quits. A little back story first.

I'm 26, she's 23. We've been together for about 9 months but we've been friends for about 2 years prior to dating. We've had our problems from the outset of dating, most of which we worked out. I've recently been thinking that she probably isn't "the one" and I actually tried to break it off last Friday. Instead of breaking up, we ended up talking about everything for a few hours and I thought I had made a mistake.

I should have gone with my gut and stuck to my guns.

Now I don't know what to do, I realize that no matter what I do, I'll be a bigger asshole in the end and I'm willing to accept this, but I just don't know how to break it to her again? I'm worried that if I do it face to face again, the same thing might happen, but not doing it in person seems very impersonal and cold. 

Does anyone have some suggestions?
TL;DR:
