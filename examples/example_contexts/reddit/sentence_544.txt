TITLE: My [22M] Ex [22F] just asked me to be FWBs after we just reconnected after 3 years. I still love her.
POST: So we broke up when I went to University. I hated breaking up with her but thought it was for the best for her sake as she couldn't deal with me being away at all. I have on year left and am home for the Summer, I posted on here before and was encouraged to reconnect with her.

We met up and it was amazing tbh. She messaged me after saying how great it was and that it felt just like old times. I realised that my feelings for her are still very much real. We then talked on FaceBook through to the early morning after she left (this was last night). We messaged constantly for a couple of days before meeting up.

Well today she messaged me asking if I wanted to be FWBs with her. My problem is I still love her, shes still the same girl I fell in love with all those years ago and seeing her was just incredible. I don't know what to say.

I kind of feel like shes saying this because she knows I still have to go away and do my final year of University (note, it requires a plane journey to visit). I can't just tell her I still have feeling for her because first of all I want to make sure I do that face to face, and secondly I don't know if shes ready to hear it yet. I really broke her heart, at first when we met up she couldn't even look at me she was so nervous. I don't want to scare her off.

I have no idea what to say to her, or what to do.
TL;DR:
