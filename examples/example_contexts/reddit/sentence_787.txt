TITLE: TIFU by changing up a routine
POST: This happened a few days ago, but I figured that I'd let the weekend NSFW posts have their fun before I posted my TIFU. 

It's Friday night and, being the total nerd that I am, I go to play Friday Night Magic at my local card shop.  I had a good night at FNM and was headed home, but needed gas for my car. I stopped and got gas and then returned home. After getting some ZZZ's, my dad, his GF, and I all go to lunch, and then once we returned, I packed my stuff back up to head back to Uni. All pretty normal stuff. But...I don't have my wallet. WHERE IS MY WALLET. I backtrack like crazy and tear apart the house. 

This is where my TIFU happened. Usually, whenever I get gas, I get out of my car, leave the car door open, scan my debt card, and then throw my wallet back into my drivers seat. 

Well I don't remember exactly why or what reason, but I didn't follow that routine this time around. I think I was thinking about going in for some coffee because it was late...

So I drive an hour back down to the gas station and start to go back over my route home from last night. And behold, my wallet lying there on the side of the road. I pull over (carefully because this is a /very/ busy road) and pick up my wallet. It is pretty much destroyed. The outer layer is fine and has a few scratches, but the inside flaps have been ran over so many times, they were torn to pieces....

Also, none of my cards were in it. Panic ensues. 

I spend ~20 minutes picking up individual cards off the side of the road only to learn that most of them would need replacing because gravel had been all but imbedded in them. Everything was there, and my debt card/identity wasn't stolen, but it's still quite the hassle.
TL;DR:
