TITLE: Having to choose between two high schools, need advice.
POST: I'm a going to be in 10th grade next month but i have to choose between two high schools. I'm really determined to pursue a career in animation/arts and went to a very good public high school with a after school arts program where I have a four hour art class every day. I thought this was helpful and would help out getting into an art university. The second high school is a charter school (Media Arts is the focus) and is project based learning. I thought this would help me because i'm not very strong in my academics but have read reviews the school wasn't very strong with math (which is the class i've struggled with most all my life) and am worried i won't be prepared for college classes. I'm very well adjusted (socially at least) to the high school i went to last year but am not sure what will be better. People i've talked to say either high school i choose will be good, but i am terrified that i will not make a good choice. I feel terrified this decision may alter my future either in a good way or bad way, I'm not sure. I've always struggled with academics and i have depression, so this situation makes me extremely stressed out. I know if i choose the new school i will leave my friends but i tell myself friends shouldn't impact my decision at all. I'm sorry if this is just plain stupid, but i don't know how to decide. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to make a decision, or make it easier.
TL;DR:
