TITLE: Me [19 F] with my roommates [19-21F]. One of our roommates is awful.
POST: Hi, first off, sorry for the formatting; I'm doing this on mobile. Second, I don't if this is going to come off petty, but I'm out of ideas. 

I'm a sophomore in college and currently living in an apartment with 4 other girls. Three of the girls I knew my freshmen year and we decided to live together. When we looked for housing, our ideal apartment only had 5 bedrooms left so we had to have an extra roommate placed with us. We were all ok with this as most of us are laid back. However, when we first met our roommate we found out she was an exchange student. 

Which is no big deal, but some of her lifestyle ideals are different because of the culture she grew up in. First, she doesn't want anyone talking or using the living room past midnight; which is pretty much impossible for college students living a college lifestyle. Second, she wants the doors to be locked at all times, and gets angry when someone leaves the door unlocked. These first two rules are livable, and my roommates and I all try to be as quiet as possible after midnight and lock the doors when leaving or before bed. But recently she has wanted to keep the heat at 73 degrees. We're living in the Midwest so the average temperature outside is about 20 degrees Fahrenheit. By keeping it at 73, we are increasing our electrical bill astronomically. Last month is was $300. This roommate also has a space heater that she leaves running constantly. One of my other roommates tried to counter this by turning down the heat whenever she could. This still uses a lot of electricity as we cycle from hot and cold. What can I do about this reddit, are there any options? We all signed separate leases, and there's not a way to switch roommates. I just can't afford to keep paying $60 a month for electricity. Ideally the temperature would be around 65-68 degrees but she says anything lower will make her sick.
TL;DR:
