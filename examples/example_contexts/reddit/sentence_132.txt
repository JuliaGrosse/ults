TITLE: Opening Roth IRA related to expected income
POST: Hi, personal finance!  I have read the breakdown provided on the side about IRAs and have researched the difference between the two, and still can't find a straight answer on my dilemma.  

So the current situation is this:  I am 28 years old and I made $95,000 last year.  My job has a $50,000 base salary then the rest is commission based.  I currently have loans to pay (auto and school), I have an emergency fund, and a comfortable amount of cash in my checking account.

SO - I know now is a good time to start saving for retirement.   Based on my income, and the implications of being able to withdraw tax free in my retirement, the Roth seems the obvious choice.  

However, I keep making more and more.  And should I hit my goals this year I will be above the income limit for a Roth ($116,000).  So my question is - Should I open the Roth now with the knowledge that I may be over the threshold this year or within a couple years?  Will I be shooting myself in the foot by then having two separate IRAs. Can they be combined?  If not will I have hypothetically a Roth worth for example $10,000 from late 20s and then a traditional as I grew into a higher salary?  I have heard of back door contributions  - is this the answer?
TL;DR:
