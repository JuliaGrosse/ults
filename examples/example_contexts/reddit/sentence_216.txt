TITLE: Hey Reddit, should I change my Wi-Fi password and cut my freeloading, friendly neighbors off?
POST: Three college chicks moved in next door to me and my roommate. They're all really laid back and have been good neighbors. However, we entered into an arrangement that allowed them access to our Wi-Fi, as long as they paid half the bill (half being $30/month). This arrangement began in October. My roommate and I have still not received a dime. I've spoken with them about it multiple times and they always promise to pay soon, but it never happens. I understand, they're broke college kids. I've been there. But they all have OK jobs and well-off parents and should be able to afford $10/month (per person).

So here's my question: Should I change my Wi-Fi password until they pay? Should I go all Tanya Harding/Stewie Griffin and beat my money out of them? Or should I just let them freeload?
TL;DR:
