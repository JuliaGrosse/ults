TITLE: New home = New aggression problems
POST: Hello!

I come to this sub in the hopes that i could get some help with my 1 year old Pitbull mix. Otis is a very friendly and loving dog. He gets along just fine with people and random people on the street during walks. At my old house he had a 7 year old chihuahua as a friend and for the most part they got along just fine. We would have the occasional problem with Otis being too big to play with the little chihuahua.

We moved to a new home this month so Otis had a lot of new things to get used to. One main thing is that now he has neighbor dogs to deal with. The people to the left of me have dachshund\wiener dogs while the neighbors behind me have a pitbull and german shepard. 

I usually let Otis out every couple hours to get some fresh air and to run around. Recently he's been very aggressive towards the dachshunds and to be honest its kind of scary. He will bark and even bite at the fence as if hes pissed off. He WONT listen to any commands and when i put his leash on the fights me and tugs just so he can get back to the fence. As soon as he is back in the house he goes back to being the mellow friendly giant that he is. 

I don't want to have a bad impression with my new neighbors. Lately he will come out back and try to say hello and be causal with otis. He's a nice guy so i would have to have problems later on down the road. 

Where should I go from here? should I speak to a vet about neutering him? Should i seek professional help? I'm not one to give up on a dog so i just want to see if there are options. I'd appreciate any help or advice!
