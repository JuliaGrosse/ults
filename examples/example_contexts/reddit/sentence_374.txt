SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Married man (29). Love my wife (30) but I keep falling in love with other women I meet.
POST: I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal. 

I've been with my wife since the very first week of university, when we were 18, and although I love her very much I very often crave that feeling of falling in love again. I often think we just got together too young and that I've never really experienced falling in love as an adult. 

Case in point: I was at a conference for work this week and this beautiful redhead wouldn't stop giving me the eye. All I could think about was going over and introducing myself, but obviously couldn't go through with it (I'm not one for cheating). 

Separately I met another girl and it transpired we had almost exactly the same taste in music, which is kind of obscure. I don't meet people like that very often, let alone attractive women!

It's not solely a sexual thing. I start fantasising about dates with these women, actually falling for them - growing old with them even. It actually hurts a little bit that I can't go through with it.

I think there is a small element of being bored in a long-term relationship (my marriage is good overall, but obviously lacking in the passion and attention we had for each other at first). There's also a small element of ego, as I have got into much better shape in recent years and girls have started noticing me, which didn't really happen before. 

Is this something that happens to most guys? What about women? I'd love to hear your input.
TL;DR:
