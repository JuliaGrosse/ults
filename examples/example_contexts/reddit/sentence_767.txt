TITLE: TIFU by accidentally being racist.
POST: I am white which is important in this FU and I work work at one for one of U.S. most popular superstores as a stocker and was asked to stand as a greeter for 2 hours today during my normal shift. I was told to do the normal have a good day thing and (important) ask to see receipts of customers I did not see check out.
         Everything was going fine and everyone was pretty used to the receipt things so I was feeling confident. I can see 2 white families checking out and start to head my way as a black female I had not seen checkout (large store so I can't see both ends of registers.) comes to leave from the side I could not see.
        Without thinking I walk past both white families and request the black woman's receipt.  She takes this as she is black and that is why I chose her instead of the other two and starts yelling at Mr calling me a racist and a bunch of other expletives. After about 30 seconds of just standing their my manager arrives and tells her I'm a racist (manager is black as well).
          Later I talk to my manager and explain what happened.  She is okay and understands but I have to do a long online course on communication and appropriate behavior because customer filed a complaint against me.
TL;DR:
