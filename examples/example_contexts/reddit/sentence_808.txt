TITLE: My girlfriend [17/F] has pretty severe anxiety/depression/OCD. I'm (18/M) worried that having to counsel her daily is putting a strain on our relationship. (1.5 years)
POST: My girlfriend has pretty severe anxiety and depression, and was recently diagnosed with a form of OCD, called OCT (Obsessive Compulsive Traits) which basically means she has some symptoms of OCD, but not enough to be complete OCD.

She has a really intense fear of death, that is triggered multiple times a day and because of this I find myself transforming from a boyfriend into a counsellor. Because I'm not a counsellor, nor have I done training, I find that I can only help to a point and can't help but beat myself up when I can't make her feel better. I understand how complex and complicated mental illness can be, as I've also been diagnosed with Depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

When I'm feeling down I immediately feel guilty as I know that me being upset will effect my girlfriend, and exacerbate her illnesses.

I'm worried that having to counsel my girlfriend so often, and now being scared of having her aid me when I am upset is putting a strain on our relationship. I truly love my girlfriend, and we communicate really well, but I have no idea how to communicate something like this to her without hurting her.
TL;DR:
