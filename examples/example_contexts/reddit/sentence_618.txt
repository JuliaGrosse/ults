TITLE: Can two corporations/company exist with the same name? ( Concerns in legal embroideries )
POST: I have recently started some research about establishing a small company. I'd like to produce apparel. I was wondering if two companies with the same name co-exist. When I am talking about company name, I do not mean a company's name in paper, but rather what I can embroider on my products. 

1.  For example,can  a company, which makes clothing co-exists with another company, while both companies have the same name.

2. A company (one) which produces apparel which does not compare to the other company (two).  one produces bags, gloves, jackets. two produces  summer items such as shirts, polos, and shorts.

To my knowledge the company that was created first, and is financially strong can claim a dispute with the new company that has been established. What is the name was the same, but logos different? Would it matter? When I mean company name, I do not mean a holding company, but rather what is embroidered into the products. 

  This is a vague example, but can I embroider the name "THUNDER" and picture : just as how polo embroiders their player and horse with name. Furthermore another company has the word "THUNDER" embroidered, but with a different picture. Can I legally do that? 

There is quite a difference between polo and polo assn. The horse, the players and the name. Although it does somewhat relate to what I am facing. "POLO" is in both shirts, but both are for different companies. 
POLO VS POLO ASSN
TL;DR:
