TITLE: Me[25/M] Her [24/F] 2 yrs together: Stupid fight, but I think her solution is silly...
POST: I apologize in advance because I realize that many people in this thread have much more serious relationship problems than I do.  But a recent fight btwn me and my GF of 2 yrs is driving me crazy and I need thoughts/perspective.

She and I both love stupid, Michael-Bay-style, summer blockbuster, blow shit up movies.  We love watching them together. On a couple of rare occasions before, we've expressed interest in watching movies XYZ--and then I went out to watch XYZ with family or friends without her, due to various circumstances.  She jokingly gave me grief about that and ended up never watching XYZ even though I said I'd watch it again with her, because she said she would feel like I would only be doing that out of obligation to her.

Last month I watched F&F6--a movie she's been talking about for a year--without her bc she was at a rehearsal dinner that night.  I was out with a friend who suggested going to watch it, and we didn't have anything better to do that night, so we did.  I also watched it the day after with her, and didn't tell her about my first viewing until yesterday. Now she's pissed that I watched it without her AND I hid the fact.

I do not see why she won't let me watch movies with friends/family, and then watch them again with her--which I'm perfectly willing to.  Her position is that she doesn't want to feel like an obligation (on the premise that, if it weren't for her, I wouldn't watch the movie twice).  She wants me to tell my friends that I've already committed to seeing the movie with her, or to have us all go together when possible, or to just watch things with my friends and she'll watch the movie separately.  Thoughts?
TL;DR:
