TITLE: TIFU by speaking with a fake accent at the worst possible time.
POST: Yes, literally today. I was going in for an interview for basically my dream job. I was extremely nervous... Like voice a little shaky nervous.

Now a little background, when I hang out with my girlfriend I commonly use stupid, silly, fake accents when I talk to her because it makes her laugh. I do it so much that sometimes I'll have an entire conversation in my southern (USA) accent or Indian accent. It almost became a habit for talking with her like that... 

So the HR girl, Marie, comes out as I'm waiting and says "Hey there _____! So glad you could come in today! etc etc" and reaches out for a handshake. I go "yeah I'm real excited to be here too, thanks for bringin' me in" or something like that.....

In a real heavy, molasses sounding southern accent.

Then I just fucking panicked. What do I do? My brain shut down. I followed Marie into the interview room making small talk. At this point there was no going back. I gave the entire interview in that goddamn accent without exception. And, it actually went pretty well.

So if I get the call..........

Not really sure what to do.
TL;DR:
