TITLE: Am I a terrible person or is this irrational behavior?
POST: Hey guys. Throwaway here.

So I've been seeing this girl for maybe two to three weeks. Been on maybe three or four dates with her. Last one we had, we ended up in bed together, which for me is pretty fast. I was a little weirded out by it but was not overly concerned. I figured it was just one of those things.

I sms'ed her the next day about something or other, she replied amicably. I didn't think anything was wrong. Then we didn't have any contact for about three days (over the weekend). Today I had this email waiting for me:

"I take it from the lack of communication that you don't want anything to do with me any more. If I'm wrong, great. But I doubt it.

I really thought you were better than this. I suggest that next time you just want to use someone for a one-off fuck, grow up and be up-front about it from the start. And if you lose interest, get over being a spineless creep and say you're not interested any more, instead of just going silent. Or maybe you just get a kick out of playing games with people's feelings (so this email will be a bonus, do enjoy the thrill of knowing you've upset me). Clearly you're just another devious play-acting cunt-rag."

I've tried calling her, emailing her, she doesn't respond. I suspect she's blocked my number and spammed my email address.

I really like(d) this girl, and I feel really bad. I know it's like Relationship 101 to call someone after you sleep with them, but I was actually genuinely busy and hadn't got round to it. Our relationship up to that point had been very casual. I fully intended to see her again. I didn't actually want to sleep with her, and I definitely wasn't trying to ditch her after I'd 'got what I wanted'. Am I wrong? Is she maybe a little bit irrational? How should I proceed?
TL;DR:
