SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I (24, M) went barhopping with some friends (20s, F & M) and a drunk coworker was harassing one of them. He took knowing me as license to harass her even more.
POST: I went out barhopping with some friends for a birthday party. This was my first time doing anything of the sort (barhopping, drinking more than one beer in a night, etc.) Everything was going well until some guy began making unwanted advances toward one of my female friends. 

He got in her space, tried to grind on her, etc. She shook her head no, told him to back off, scowled at him, moved away from him, etc. I recognized him as a coworker (works in a building 15 miles away from me, so I only recognized him, didn't know him well.) I acknowledged him, thinking that he would back off if he realized that someone he worked with was witnessing this.  He then continued even more aggressively, while my friend thought that she couldn't be as confrontational because I knew the creep.

She told him to back off. I took him aside, told him she wasn't interested and he needed to back off, and he continued. At this point, I had no idea what to do. 

My questions are: How do I smooth this over with my friend? (She has said that this happens to her often, but I feel partially responsible) In what way can I confront this coworker the next time I see him outside of work? And if this ever happens again how can I put a stop to it?
TL;DR:
