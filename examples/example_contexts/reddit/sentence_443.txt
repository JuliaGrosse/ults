TITLE: Am I[17/M] right to be annoyed at girlfriend[17/F] because her choice of best friend[17/M]?
POST: We've been together for ~5 months and I'd say we work pretty well. Lately she's become best friends with a guy who had an insane thing for her around the time we got together, and as a result he started to badmouth me to people (including my close friend group). They also made out on Christmas day, just a few days before we started seeing each other. They see each other a lot (pretty much whenever we're not together). I know she won't cheat but I feel a bit uncomfortable knowing that she's so close with a guy who openly talked shit about me. 

As soon as I started feeling this way I told her about it, and she agreed with me when I told her I thought he was shitty, but she still hangs out with him. I'm not going to give her an ultimatum or anything, but I'm feeling a little annoyed that she said that she agrees with me about him. She is still best friends with him, and sees him regularly.

I feel like I'm being a bit shitty for thinking this, but I'm sure if It were me in her situation I'd have acted totally differently.
TL;DR:
