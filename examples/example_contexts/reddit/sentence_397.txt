TITLE: 21F and I always "brozone" myself.
POST: Hello all!!! Here is the story. I am a 21 year old female with a unique issue. I was raised by my dad, and I have my own share of commitment issues. I'm terrified that someone is going to bet under my skin and hurt me, so I usually date guys that I feel sort of apathetic towards. Like, I like them, but not enough to where they can hurt me. Recently, I met a guy that changed that. 

He is, quite possibly the most attractive guy I have ever met. We've hung out a couple times, had sex (it's not a huge deal to either of us), and I see myself starting to do something I do pretty often. 

When I meet a guy that I think I could have real feelings for, I tend to "brozone" myself. I call it brozining because it's a little more severe than friendzoning in my opinion. I tend to GO OUT OF MY WAY to make the guy think I am super tough and stuff. I'll arm wrestle with them, tell them I'm tougher, eat spicier food, etc. 

I really like this guy, reddit. I do not want to mess this up. What are some ways I can AVIOD brozining????

Thanks for reading!!!
