TITLE: My (F15) relationship with my dad (40) is falling apart due to his girlfriend (19)
POST: Okay, my parents got divorced about two years ago. They were both cheating on each other. They got new partners relatively quickly (about 2 months after everything was final. ) What gets weird is my dads girlfriend (now fianc√©. ) is only 19. She went to school with my sister (20) and she's been like a family friend since they were in 7th grade. She is now beyond rude to us (my sister and I, and our brother who is 8) She hasn't finished highschool, and has no job. She had a 3 year old who's father is not in the picture. Sometimes she comes home smelling strongly of marijuana and sometimes of alcohol. While I think if she wants to smoke, that's fine, but I think it's really inappropriate for her to come home to her child while buzzed. I've talked to my dad countless times about how it makes me uncomfortable, but he sees no problem with it. I've talked to him about how she says rude things about my sister (calling her names, complaining about how she lives with our dad still, etc. ) but he still does nothing. My dad is starting to act like her and it worries me. He could have a wonderful woman, but he's choosing her, and his relationship with his kids is at stake. I'm too embarrassed about it to talk to anybody else about it, so is there anything I can do to try and make him see where his kids are coming from? Or should I just leave him be and hope that he sees that she's not the best thing he could have? Please help.
