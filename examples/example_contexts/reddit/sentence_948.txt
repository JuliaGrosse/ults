TITLE: Reddit, have you ever had to give up a pet?
POST: Hey Reddit,

So a little background:  I have a parrotlet named Cielo and I've had him since he was 5 weeks old.  He's 11 months old now, and recently started talking and can say, "Kisses!", "Step up!", and "Hey, bird!".

It goes without saying that we share a special bond;  I love my little guy!

The trouble is, however, I'm a recent college graduate.  I haven't been able to find any jobs or internships in the area and plan on moving wherever I find one.  It'd be difficult to take little Cielo with me because it's at least $100 to fly him with me one way, don't have a car, and plan on moving wherever I can find a job.  And there, the worry is whether I can find a place that would allow pets.

Having him during the year was a bit difficult, too, and I often gave up precious study time to come home and take him out of the cage to play.

I feel like at this life stage, I'm not exactly ready to have a pet.  I feel that I *should* give him to a family so that he could have a more stable life (not that I don't take great care of him!) and also 

But at the same time, I feel that I know him best and would love him best (cliche, I know).  He's also bonded to me, so I'm wondering how it would affect him.

In an ideal situation, I could find a fellow bird-lover who's experienced with parrots and is willing to take another bird under his wing.  So far, I've had no luck finding anyone :(

So what should I do, Reddit?  To be completely honest, I don't feel as though I have the time to devote to a pet and would love to find him a happy new home.  I think I'd just have trouble letting go and believing that others would take care of him as well as I did.

What's your opinion of the situation?  Have you ever had any similar experiences?
TL;DR:
