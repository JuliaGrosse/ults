TITLE: My [22m] girlfriend [20f] of 7 months is having anxiety about us
POST: So here's the deal. Girlfriend and I got together tonight to talk and hang out like normal (we both just got back from thanksgiving break and wanted to have some time together - we are both in college at the moment). We are having a great conversation and having fun. Then all of a sudden she sort of dropped a bomb on me. She told me she's been having anxiety about our future together. She said that she didn't want to break up, I make her extremely happy, it has absolutely nothing to do with me, but she's told me that something just isn't sitting right. I was sort of confused and frankly a little blindsided, but I asked her what she meant. She tried to explain as best she could, and said that for the last couple weeks she's just been really unsure about our relationship and just wondering if it is right/best for the both of us. Again emphasizing that it didn't have anything to do with me and she was just not feeling right about something. I pressed in a little and tried to see what the root was but honestly I don't even think she knows. 

Reddit, this is tearing me up. I hate to see her like this. I absolutely love this girl and would do anything in the world for her. I just don't know what to do or say or anything. I want to make it all better but can't. I feel like crap and wish I had a magic phrase I could say to make her feel better about us. But I can't. I'm not sure where to go from here and any honest advice is greatly appreciated.
TL;DR:
