TITLE: IT GETS BETTER, just maintain NC!
POST: I'm (24m) 3 weeks of NC and I am feeling a lot better than I thought I would. I've made it a priority to hang out with friends and do stuff that I know I wasn't "allowed" to do while in a relationship.

For everyone in the position as me, KEEP NC. There are some days that you want to talk so bad, but don't. Put your phone away, tell your bud to put a passlock on your phone. Do anything it takes.

If they contact you to see how you are, don't answer. This will be hard, but like other people here have said, until you can picture her sucking some guy's dick (or if you are a girl, ramming some chick from behind) and not feel anything, you aren't ready for friendly contact. My ex likes to make it subtle, whether it be to favorite a tweet or like an instagram picture, but fuck that. She doesn't deserve someone like me in her life right now.

It's almost new years! Go out, have fun with friends, forget everything bad about your life. It's a New Year! Make the most of it bitches!
