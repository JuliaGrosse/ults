TITLE: Me [22 F] with my best friend [25 M] 3 years, If you're a nervous wreck, is telling someone how you feel about them over text appropriate?
POST: I've liked this same guy for an embarassing amount of time. I've been trying to ask him out, but I get so nervous (in a good way!) around him...plus we both talk a lot so it is hard to get a word in (lol). 

We are both very close and are good friends, but I want to be something more. Would it be appropriate to tell him how I feel through a text or private message? Just wondering what opinions others may have about this. 

Would you be offended? Would you be doubtful of what the person was telling you? How would you overcome the nerves and tell them in person? Any thoughts/opinions/insights would be very helpful!
TL;DR:
