TITLE: Xmas Sacrifice "Lesson" - parental guidance required
POST: A friend told me about a family Christmas tradition where they ask their children to give up one gift off their "wish-list" in exchange for putting that money towards a charity. This seemed like a great idea so I attempted it with my 5 year old daughter and it didn't go that well. Instead of letting her pick, I suggested a toy castle she wants (and already has a couple similar) and in exchange, suggested we buy a less fortunate family a goat through a charity site.

It turned out to be a far more challenging decision for her to make than I anticipated and it took lots of explaining and tears. Turns out she really wanted that castle. She finally made the right choice and reluctantly agreed. However in hindsight I feel like it was too intense of a request to ask from a 5 year old, that maybe I was too pushy and generally I feel like crap about the whole thing.  By the time she went to bed I think she was feeling good about her decision and it hasn't come up again.

Now I have two choices: 1) Complete the "lesson", stick to my plan and just not buy it. Â The charity is sending a card with a picture of the goat I was going to put under the tree for thanks. 2). "Reward" her kind act by still buying the castle and say its from Santa and he decided to give to her because he was "so impressed with her generous act".  Thus still making her extremely happy and surprised Xmas morning.

Needless to say she is getting other toys she requested Xmas morn.

Suggestions?
