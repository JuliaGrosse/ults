TITLE: I'm (21F) dating (20F) for 5 years now..and its getting complicated
POST: I'm a girl. I've been with my girlfriend for about five years and I love

 her to death. This is the first girl I had been with or have even been

 attracted to. Other than that I love boys. We have been through

 some crazy shit and been fighting for our relationship since it had

 started. But lately I'm not sure how I have been feeling. I care about

 her so much but in my future I don't see it being her. I want to have

 babies in the future and I feel like I have been missing out on things

 like meeting new people. we have always hung out together 24/7

 and I feel like I don't have my own identity. how do I bring this up?

 how do I go about it?  I don't know if this a phase or what to do.

 Just end it? I just don't wanna lose her completely. Because I know 

she is head over heels in love with me.  Has anyone else gone

 through this or have any advice? Should I wait it out?
TL;DR:
