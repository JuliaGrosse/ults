TITLE: Trying To Explain How I Feel About My Grandfather's death (on dad's side) To Christian Group At School
POST: Some background information is required:

I am a guy. Just last week, my grandfather on my dad's side passed away. This has not hit me very hard since I only saw him three times in my lifetime: 1) When I was like 2 - 3 years old. 2) When I was around 10 or 11 years old. 3) When I was 24 years old. (He lives in Hong Kong & my family lives here in the United States) 

Today, I told a few friends from my Christian group at school about my grandfather's death. After explaining to one woman that I was not close to my grandfather, she proceeds to become irate and think that I have used the Christian group to get them to feel sorry for me. (They tell me that they do not think that they are being used) I feel that when my grandfather died, I realized how soon, my parents will soon pass (my dad's mom is still alive, but has stage four Alzheimer's so I am guessing she has no idea my grandfather has passed) Both of my mom's parents are still alive but their days are numbered. 

How do I deal with this woman & get her to understand my point of view?
TL;DR:
