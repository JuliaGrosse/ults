TITLE: Does he [M23] have feelings for me [F22] even though he's focusing on his career?
POST: I dated a friend a couple summers ago and nothing came of it because he moved abroad for work. His brother passed away shortly thereafter and he didn't end up keeping in touch very much.

He came into town a few weeks ago and immediately wanted to see me. He ended up blowing off all of his friends to spend time with me and we cuddled and talked for several hours. (He tried to kiss me and I didn't let him, but we hung-out for a few more hours after that.)

He apologized several times for not keeping in touch better and for abruptly leaving to start his career. He said that he had a lot of fun last summer and would keep in touch a lot better from now on. I asked him flat out if he would've dated me if he'd stayed local, and he said he definitely would've thought about it because we are compatible in so many ways.

He then proceeded to give me his life plan. He says he wants to spent the next couple years developing his career abroad, but that he eventually wants to come back to the states and start a family. He says he's only had one serious relationship that lasted five years and has only liked two-three girls his whole life. (I was dying to ask whether I was one of those girls, but I resisted the temptation.)

Anyways, he's moving abroad again and is visiting so many exciting places. But he's kept up on his promise to keep in touch. We've skyped once and have plans to skype again next week. He also reiterated that I can text him whenever I want and that it'd be a great way to keep in touch. He answers my text messages fairly quickly whenever I do have something to say to him.

Okay, so I get he's not about to be my boyfriend any time soon. I'm also going to keep dating other people who are more local. But does he have feelings for me? Or am I just a friend who's convenient to cuddle with? I really want to know what he's thinking.
TL;DR:
