TITLE: My BF [25M] of a year is beginning to treat me [22F] more like a friend rather than a GF. Should I just break up with him?
POST: My boyfriend is not a great communicator and it's gotten worse. He's gradually began to become less affectionate, at this point I feel like another one of his friends rather than his SO. 

Hes become less invested in our relationship and I feel like sometimes he couldn't care less about communicating with me on a regular basis. He used to be so infatuated with me and used to love talking to me but now I am not sure if he is just getting bored. I really don't know if I should still be with him or break up, any suggestions would help.
TL;DR:
