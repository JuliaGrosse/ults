TITLE: Right person, wrong time?
POST: I'm in a right person, wrong time situation right now and it's a very hard, sad thing to sort out. We have been dating for a year and a half and at the end of the summer I'm moving away to the UK to attend a prestigious law school for three years and my boyfriend has three years left of his degree in Canada. He's the first person I've ever loved and we get along so well. I consider him my best friend, we talk everyday, and we're just easily compatible. Our relationship isn't perfect and neither is he but nobody is and I could see myself being with him and being happy for a long time. However, studying law and studying abroad has always been a dream of mine and I've worked really hard to get this so it's an opportunity I can't pass up. It doesn't change the fact that I have to end this amazing relationship with a guy I love. I hate the thought of him being with another girl but I know it'll happen and I'm terrified of losing contact with him and becoming strangers. I wonder how long it'll take for me and for him to move on. Do you think if we were to meet again at the right place and right time in our lives we could be together again?
TL;DR:
