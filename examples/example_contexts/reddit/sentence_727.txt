TITLE: My [22 M] live-in girlfriend [22 F] is backing out of our "deal" for Thanksgiving
POST: Katie and I have been dating for almost 2 years.  We moved in together last January.  Things have been kind of up and down but we always seem to work things out.

Last year, I spent the whole Thanksgiving with her family and we decided that this year she would spend the whole Thanksgiving with my family.  I reminded her of that deal about a month ago and it took her a moment to remember.  After remembering, she seemed very hesitant to continue with what we had agreed upon.  I explained it was only fair that we did it this way.  Next year, we can split up the day... My family in the early afternoon and her family in the evening.  She reluctantly agreed to it again.

Then this past weekend, I talked to her about it again.  I said to her, "I don't want you to be there if you, truly in your heart, don't want to be there.  It would be unfair to both of us.  So you decide what you want to do.  I will be so happy if you chose to be with me.  If you don't, honestly, I will be pretty upset.  You will be hurting me.  With that said, choose what you want to do in your heart.  I really want you to be happy on that day."

So now my question...  I feel like I have been getting let down by this girl constantly.  She's always choosing her family above me.  I know we aren't married but we have a serious relationship, potentially working towards marriage.  Now is the time when I want to be put first, ahead of anyone else.  I did it last year for her, now it's her turn.  

Is it wrong of me to consider breaking up with her over this?  If she doesn't spend Thanksgiving with my family, should I break up with her?  What if she spends half with me then half with her family?  She's getting exactly what she wants.  But she's not sacrificing anything for me.

What would you do?
