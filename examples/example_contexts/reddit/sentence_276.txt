TITLE: (Nebraska) I was hammered and got tossed out of a bar last weekend.
POST: I got hammered for someone's birthday last weekend shots kept coming and I rarely drink. I blacked out I don't remember any of this.

Supposedly I had a verbal argument with the bartender and the doorguy ended up dragging me out of the bar by the neck. I know i was an idiot for getting so drunk. 

Now I'm fairly certain i have an injury to my hyoid bone in my neck, I can feel how far in the right side goes compared to my left. And it hurts to swallow. 

I set an appointment, but its through the VA so i have to wait. 

If there is an actual injury can I sue the guy? 

For what its worth my friends said they didn't see me do anything then all of a sudden i was put into a headlock from behind. They had no idea why. 

When i went back to the bar the next day to get my card (they threw it out) the bartender was the one that said what happened. Of course I believe them, why else would that have happened?
TL;DR:
