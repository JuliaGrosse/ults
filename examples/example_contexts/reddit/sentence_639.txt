TITLE: Financially drowning and it's my own fault. Now how do I start the climb out of this?
POST: I am about to finish grad school and have more student loan bills coming up. Right now I have 2 credit cards I haven't been able to pay in forever, tickets and such that I can't afford and have turned into warrants, a car that is on its last legs and nothing but trouble, and I owe 2 friends money. I just got a second job that should at least give me the ability to start paying somethings off. 

Should I consider consolidating my debt? I figure I should pay the tickets off first so I don't go to jail. I really just need tips on how to start this process so it doesn't feel so hopeless. It has me really depressed right now which only leads to problem avoidance and denial. I need to change this situation starting now!
TL;DR:
