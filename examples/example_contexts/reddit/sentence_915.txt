TITLE: How crazy am I [27F] to date my boyfriend [28M] of 1 month?
POST: I met my boyfriend in a bar six weeks ago, and since exchanging numbers we have been like crack to each other. Together all the time, hardcore infatuated. I'm so intoxicated by him that I think I'm having trouble seeing the situation clearly, despite being a rational person in the rest of my life.

I'm in the first year of a doctorate that will give me a professional credential I'll be able to have a very nice career with. For now I'm living on a grad student stipend, so I'm not rich, but I did get a prestigious fellowship that allows me to work a lot less than the rest of my classmates (no need for an extra campus job in order to get paid). So I have a lot of free time. My coursework is also quite easy. In order to start this program I had to relocate to a new city pretty far from anyone I know. So far, in fact, that the culture here is really different from anything I'm used to, and it hasn't been that easy to make friends over the past 6 months. I've felt pretty lonely and isolated. To top it off, I broke up with my long distance SO of 2.5 years in November.

I met my new bf only a few weeks after that breakup. He's my age but lives the same way that someone ten years younger would: at mom's house, working a shitty shift-based job, with only a few years of community college that he never finished. He also had a 2 year old daughter (who I love). He doesn't have an academic mind, if you know what I mean. He's much more of a visual thinker. And he's an MMA fighter.

Obviously my parents aren't thrilled that after my ivy educated PhD ex I have found this guy. Heck even his mom thinks I'm "too good" for him! On paper he sounds terrible. But he's really physically and emotionally compatible with me and he makes me really happy.
TL;DR:
