TITLE: TIFU by hitting on a girl at the gym
POST: This actually happened the other day. I am a regular at the big box gym here in town and have been for years. I also almost invariably go there early in the morning on the same days as I've made friends with a lot of the other guys that are there at the same time. 

So over the past few months I've noticed a new girl that seems to be on the same schedule as me. She's very fit and athletic looking. She is often wearing shirts for one of the private universities in the state, so I'm figuring she must be a former college athlete coming in before work. She doesn't really talk to anyone, but I've noticed her looking at me a few times. 

The other day, I was finishing up my workout and getting ready to go, when I saw that she was set up behind a booth for one of the health/vitamin stores giving out free samples and what not. So, I stopped by the table before I left and chatted her up a bit. In the end, I said we should hang out sometime and then got her number. Score! Or so I thought. 

Now, I should mention that I just turned 30. I do, however, look much younger than that as I'm in really good shape and well, genetics. 

Anyways, I was about to text her yesterday to set up a time to hang out, but first out of curiosity I decided to look her up on social media...and here's the fuck up. It turns out she is an athlete. A high school athlete. Needless to say, but I did not text her, and I probably need to find a new gym.
