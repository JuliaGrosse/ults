TITLE: Filming my travels without taking a whole host of electronics
POST: Hey,

This summer I'm taking part in the Mongol Rally, and last weekend there was an organised film festival event. Now I'm not planning on entering the event next year, but I would like to put a video together for memories sake etc.

Has anyone done any filming whilst travelling in remote areas? I'm not wanting to take a load of stuff like a laptop, multiple chargers, different cables and all that on the trip itself, so if anyone knows of any compact video camera's (nothing big and fancy necessary), that are of a reasonable price (I won't say cheap because if it's worth it I'll pay out a bit more anyway)?

Ideally we'd plan to connect to computers in cities to create space on internal memory/memory cards, but that may not be possible in some areas (Kazak steppes for example), so being able to take some additional storage would be useful. I do have a 3TB external harddrive that I could upload onto, but the video-camera would need to be able to link into the directly without my laptop etc.
TL;DR:
