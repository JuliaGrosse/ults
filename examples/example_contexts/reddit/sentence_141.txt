TITLE: I [18/m] am in love with a classmate [17/f], but she has a long distant relationship
POST: Hi,
like the title says, I'm very in love with her. She is in a long distant relationship, and she thinks that her boyfriend will break up with her (because she want's to go au-pair to another coutry).(Don't get me wrong, I don't want her to quit her boyfriend for me, I only wanted to say this)

She and I have many things in common, and a few days ago she invited me to her appartment, to give me some films I wanted. I was there for about 1 1/2 hours, and we talked the whole time with each other. She said I could come over any time I want. I liked it very much. I frequently write with her, too, end then we end up writing for 2 hours or so.
She's also very kind to me, but I don't know how I shall interpret this whole thing, I'm confused right now, but I really love her.

I didn't tell her yet, because I don't want to make her to force (don't know an other english word) her to make a decision.

What should I make, should I wait and see what happens with her realationship? We're in the last scholar year, I don't know if I'll be able to see her after school as frequently as now.
TL;DR:
