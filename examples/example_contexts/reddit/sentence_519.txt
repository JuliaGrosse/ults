TITLE: Read some texts I really shouldn't have. I think she's cheating. I don't know what to do.
POST: Background: I(male,27) have been dating my girlfriend(28) for 2.5 years and we have lived together for about 1.5 of those years. We have been having a little bit of problems lately but we agreed to work things out.

This morning while she was asleep I looked through her texts. I have never done this before, and never will again because I feel like a complete asshole for doing it. Basically, she has been texting another man back and forth in incredibly inappropriate ways to the point like it sounds like they may have slept together last night, or at least fooled around. She told me she was out spending time with a female friend of hers(who is a real person), but she had sent a text to that friend to cancel because she was "doing... something... :)".

I know we have been having problems, but barely a week ago she convinced me to stick with her and try to work things out. It's probably stupid of me to feel so betrayed when we were on the verge of breaking up a week ago, but I really do love this girl with all my heart and it is tearing me apart to sit here and think about what may have happened. 

I feel like a deep-fried bag of fecal matter for going through her messages, and have no idea how I should/can even address this issue with her. She is currently spending time with the same "female friend", so I haven't seen her since I this morning. Please help, I don't think this crying thing I'm currently doing is really fixing the situation all that much.
TL;DR:
