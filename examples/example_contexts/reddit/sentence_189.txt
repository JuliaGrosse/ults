TITLE: Marathon training for fit athlete but inexperienced runner
POST: Hi! This is my first time on /r/running.

I've been a female (age 21) competitive rower for the past 4 years. I've recently run out of eligibility, and am looking to running for staying in some kind of decent shape. I've always wanted to run a marathon, and I think this is a prime time in my life to try. I've been looking for basic training programs online, but I can't seem to find any that would work for someone who is in good cardiovascular shape but has very little recent running training.

The training load I am used to is 11 sessions/17 hours a week of rowing/erging. 8 of these sessions are 80-100' of steady cardiovascular work (HR 140-160ish). The other 3 are speedwork (2 sessions of 5 sets of 5' on, 5' off at HR 180+, 1 session of 16x1'on, 1:30off at max speed). I am looking to run a marathon in January. I haven't run much since December (read: one 5-6 mile run every 3 weeks or so), so I don't think I can jump right into a full running schedule that an advanced runner would use, but I also need more volume to maintain fitness than a program that a beginner would use. Ideally, I want be able to run the marathon at at least an 11' mile pace (That's about 30''/mile slower than my steady pace right now). Do you have any ideas on how I could best structure my training so that I don't lose fitness as I'm increasing my running volume? Right now, I'm looking at starting out running 4 days/week, 3mi/3mi/3mi/6mi, and supplementing the shorter runs with about 30' minutes of cardio, as well as throwing in 2 extra days of cross training. I'm not sure how quickly/slowly to ramp up the running mileage.
TL;DR:
