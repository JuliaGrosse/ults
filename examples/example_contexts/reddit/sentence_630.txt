TITLE: Thoughts on my ex [26M] of 3 years, cheating on his current gf [19F] with me [26F] but here's the kicker.
POST: So my ex of 3 years has cheated on his current gf with me a few times. One time she found out. They fought but are still together in a now rocky relationship. She hates me and won't let us see each other. But he still does and still cheats on her. But here's the kicker I have herpes. Neither of them do. He's putting her as risk all the time. He is ok with the fact I have it and knows the risks. But she is at risk and knew she was the first time she found out he cheated. But he continues. Any thoughts on this. To mean it seams like he doesn't  give two shits about her.  Thoughts?

I don't think telling her will get any where cus she is a little crazy and will think I'm just telling lies to get her to leave him. 

Please no lectures about how I should drop him like a rock because that won't be happening since we are business partners and I would loose way to much to stop working with him and please no lectures on how I should just stop sleeping with him I know this shit. 

I just wanna know your thoughts on whats the point of him doing this is. 

Also here's a little context to give you an idea of what kind of relationship  me and him had. 
From the beginning  of the relationship  we where in an open relationship  and we were allowed to sleep with other people any time we wanted, so first of all I don't  care if he cheats on her. But she wants a closed relationship with him and he says he will for he but doesn't.
TL;DR:
