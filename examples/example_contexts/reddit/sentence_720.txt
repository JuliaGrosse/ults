TITLE: [GA] Eviction notice listed on ex-girlfriend's record despite this not being the case.
POST: I live in Nevada, so I apologize in advance that I don't know what Georgia's laws are like in regards to renters' rights.

My ex-girlfriend (*who currently lives with me*) just applied to rent a condominium, but she got a call back this afternoon from the property management company that she has an eviction notice on her record which now puts the whole moving situation into jeopardy. 

When my girlfriend was living in Atlanta, she put in her 60-day notice at the apartment she was leasing on August 1st, 2014, as her lease was set to expire on October 12th, 2014. As we've been reaching out to see what's going on, we've discovered:

1. The apartment complex in question never received my ex's notice to not extend the lease agreement. They have it on record that she agreed to renew her lease which is not the case considering she left the country to do fieldwork in Mexico. 
1. The apartment complex wants her to pay $1700 for a mixture of items such as for not paying rent, movings furniture out of the apartment (*which is false*), cleaning fees, etc. 

After trying to argue her case, the apartment complex is unwilling to help my ex out, we're at a loss to what her next steps would look like. How does she fight this despite being thousands of miles away?
TL;DR:
