TITLE: TIFU by forgetting to unclog the pool's filter.
POST: We have an above-ground pool in the backyard and there are many trees around it. Last weekend my dad told me to take out the filter and empty it so the pump wouldn't get clogged.

Well... I forgot to do it for a few days and we just so happened to have a couple of rainstorms that bumped the water level above the limit for the pump. The pool was filled by leaves, branches and other stuff that fell from the trees and coupled with the high water level and my mishap, the pump died because it was overflooded by water while it's hoses were clogged by leaves.

Now, my dad is furious and I feel incredibly awful. A new pump costs about 200$ and this is not counting the hoses that exploded from the pressure and the various other parts that might be broken.
TL;DR:
