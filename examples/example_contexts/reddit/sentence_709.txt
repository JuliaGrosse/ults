TITLE: Co-worker (30F), who has feelings for me, is not happy with her marriage and wants to use me (28M) as a way to get out of it.
POST: So, a co-worker of mine (30F) and I (28 M) have gotten very close over the last few years at work.  It's obvious we both have developed feelings for each other but the problem is that she is married (for 2 years) and constantly hints to me that she isn't happy with how things have turned out.  It's incredibly annoying since if she wasn't married we would definitely be dating and I don't know what she expects me to say in these situations.  I'm not the kind of person who would ever help someone commit infidelity, but the problem is, it seems like wants me to.  

For example, both of us went to a work conference in another city together and she asked me if we could stay in the same hotel room.  I found it really strange but didn't want to make things weird between us so I just said, "Yeah, that's fine".  Obviously, nothing happened when we stayed together since it would've been a disaster to sleep with someone who I work with and it would've wrecked my conscience, considering she's married.  There have been so many examples of similar things happening and it's getting to the point where I'm trying to avoid her now.

Luckily, she'll be leaving this job in 3 months and I probably won't see her again, but it's tough because I really like her and haven't met someone who I've clicked with so well.  

Basically, how should I handle these next 3 months and how do I stop wasting my time thinking about a person who I can't be with?
TL;DR:
