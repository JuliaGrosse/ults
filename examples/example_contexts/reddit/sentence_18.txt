TITLE: Dear gamers of Reddit: How much is too much?
POST: Hello gamers! I (20) am the devoted girlfriend of a gamer (24), and let me clarify this first: I have absolutely no problem with him gaming. (I actually prefer gamers vs. non to date.) I used to game when I was younger, so I can understand the appeal.

Anyway, my boyfriend informed me last minute that he would be hosting a two week long LAN at his house. This means limited contact (except for a few messages informing me that he is still alive) and he pretty much refuses to have a phone conversation with me because he is with his bros and it is always a "bad time". 

Two days before this, he just finished a week-long camping trip with his other (male) friends.

So my question to you is: how much time should be allotted to gaming when one has a girlfriend? Do you think it should increase/stay the same/decrease when one is attached? I understand the importance of male camaraderie, but is it unrealistic for a woman to want her boyfriend to slow down on the "bro time"?

Ladies, I would also like your thoughts.
TL;DR:
