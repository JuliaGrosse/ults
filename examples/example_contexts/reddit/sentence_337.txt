TITLE: Thinking about switching majors... again.
POST: Hi guys and girls, I'm looking for some advice. When I was a freshman, I started college as a Biology major. I didn't have a plan but it sounded like a good place to start. After having to withdraw from my math class and then barely passing the second time around, plus barely getting C's in my core classes,  I decided to switch to English. It was an obvious choice because of all the extra English classes I was taking an acing. I do know the risks and challenges of switching to such a limiting major. I'm now a junior and have been looking at graduate schools for Library Science for a year now. However, the more I think about it, the more I wish I would have switched to Psychology. I've been thinking about having a Psychology minor but I love it so much that it's starting to bother me that I'll be only minoring in it. I really enjoy it, I'm good at it, and there are many more employment opportunities that actually utilize the major. I'm not looking for criticism for my decisions. I'm looking for useful advice, anecdotal evidence that I should or shouldn't switch again, and maybe a little reassurance that I'm not the only one feeling this way. I'll be talking to my adviser later this week and then doing some academic counseling. Thanks for reading.
TL;DR:
