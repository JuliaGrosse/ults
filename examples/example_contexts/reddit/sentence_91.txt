TITLE: Me [17M] with ex [17F] of a few months, I feel like I've gotten over the breakup but I think about her so often
POST: I'll try to be brief. Met this girl at the beginning of the year through a mutual friend. We hit it off right away and started seeing each other. She was my first real girlfriend, first kiss, we told each other we loved each other, typical stuff. Were together about 4 months, official about 3. Went to different schools so we saw each other between 1 and 3 times a week.

The breakup was really unexpected, to me at least. I've spoken to her since just twice, both times shortly after the breakup because, honestly, when she broke up with me, my mind was going a million miles an hour and I barely heard a word she was saying, so I just talked to her to try and get a better idea of why she ended it. Haven't seen her in person since.

We've been broken up now for 5 months and, while I think I've gotten over her, I find myself thinking about her a lot. Pretty much every day. I sort of feel like I miss her, but I'm honestly not sure sometimes if I miss her or if I miss having someone, if that makes sense. It's worth noting I go to an all-guys school so I don't have any particularly close female friends.

My question is this: Is it normal to be thinking about her so much so far gone when we have had essentially no contact since we broke up.
TL;DR:
