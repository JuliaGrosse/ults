SUBREDDIT: r/tifu
TITLE: TIFU by not interpreting hints from a girl
POST: So this happened a few years back but I just remembered it and just recently started using Reddit.

Back during uni, I was in class with a pretty cute girl and we decided to team up for a school project. She was always trying to make physical contact with me and close to the end of the project she invited me to her house to complete the project. 

We started working on the project and just chatting when she randomly pulls out a picture of a girl giving a blowjob on her laptop. She asks me if that looks like her. I said not really and continued to work on the project. Few weeks later after the class had ended, I realized my fk up. She was trying to get with me and that's why she would invite me to her house, try to touch me, etc. Only problem is I am quite possibly the biggest idiot in the world when it comes to reading/understanding women.
TL;DR:
