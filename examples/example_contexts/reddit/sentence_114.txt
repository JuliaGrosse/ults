TITLE: Me, (23F) adopted at birth and birth mother (??F): anyone else with experience with birth parents who are looking to get in touch with them?
POST: I was told when I was 11 that I was adopted at birth by my parents, and it's something I don't really think about. It's just very natural to me that the people who raised me are my parents, so I hardly thought about my birth parents.

So this week my birth mother found and got in contact with my mom. Informed her of some health problems she has that may be genetic, and said my half sister, apparently older, would like to chat with me sometime.

It hasn't hit me how I feel about it yet. I'm starting by looking objectively at the situation. I don't know anyone else who was adopted, so I don't have much experience with such a thing.

If you have any questions about my situation, feel free to ask. I just am not sure how much info is necessary, and my situation is relatively simple.
TL;DR:
