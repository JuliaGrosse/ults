TITLE: I [18M] accidentally got my girlfriend [19F] pregnant and she doesn't want an abortion. Looking for advice.
POST: I made a mistake and got my girlfriend of 2.5 years pregnant. For a bit of background, we have a great relationship, despite our distance - seeing each other is more of a monetary issue, costing about Â£20-30. She is at University and I am attending College. We usually see each other once or twice a month.

We got the news today. We are both in shock and don't know what our next step should be. 

We have discussed what we would do if she accidentally got pregnant earlier in our relationship. We have our differences in what to do, I believe due to various factors (money, distance, still being in education) we should have an abortion, however my girlfriend believes she will never get over an abortion. I respect her stance completely and will not push this choice. She doesn't like the idea of putting the child up for adoption.

So what should we do next? 

How can we keep the relationship going while mitigating the damage this may cause? 

What would life be like juggling a child, a relationship, an education and a job?

Thank you for reading.
