TITLE: Me (21/F) with my boyfriend (21/M), changing birth control methods, but nervous about how it could change our relationship.
POST: Hello all, could use an outside perspective on this. Using a throwaway account.

I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 years. I haven't been on birth control pills for the whole time, but I started about a year into our relationship. I've been thinking about switching to non hormonal birth control for some time now, as I really don't like the side effects of the pill, but unfortunately I won't be able to see my doctor for a few months for insurance reasons. So, I want to just stop my pills after this pack is up, or about 2 weeks from now, and only use condoms. 

My boyfriend and I have talked about this and he is completely on board. He is so supportive and telling me this is my decision, but he appreciates me taking his opinion into account. We haven't been using condoms since I started the pill 2 years ago.

Now here comes the issue. We are both still in school, and nowhere ready to be parents. I want to use condoms religiously and even have him pull out with the condom on. I am terrified that this change may make him resent our sex life. It has always been so relaxed while I've been on the pill, and I'm scared that this change may be a big difference compared to what it was. 

Has anybody gone through a similar experience? How was the transition?
TL;DR:
