TITLE: My [36 F] GF just broke up with me [36 M] over me not being upset with her?
POST: My GF and I have been dating for several months. Things have been going great. We're both divorced and have kids. 

This weekend she was supposed to come to my mom's with me for my daughter's birthday party. She told me last night that she couldn't come. She wasn't sure she was ready to meet my mom and she needed money from teaching on Sunday that she couldn't be back for if she went. 

I took it super in stride. I was really cool about it. I didn't get upset in the least. I was disappointed, sure, but didn't do or say anything to let it on. This morning I got up and left. She was trying to get me to talk about it and say that something was wrong. Nothing was wrong from my point of view! I was still going to have a great weekend and nothing was going to ruin that. It seemed silly to be upset.

Anyway, fast-forward a few hours, some texts, and she's breaking up with me. I guess she was just looking for a reason. It doesn't make any sense.

I was really trying to be positive and look at the good things happening in my life, ignoring the bad. Was trying to be mature in the relationship and accept disappointment gracefully. This apparently triggered her? I don't know.

Also I've bought her an appliance after one of hers failed and bought her groceries a dozen times at least. I've spent a lot of money on her and have been generous because I know she doesn't have a lot of money and I'm doing fine financially. Now she's worried I'm going to keep the keyboard she loaned my daughter. She's texting me about it non-stop about how she needs to get that back ASAP. It's really offensive.

Wanted to tell the story. Feels bad man.
