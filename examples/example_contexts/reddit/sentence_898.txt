-tells me to wait for her because she is going through shit

-doesnt talk to me much but tells me she wants to be friends

-starting to regret choice of waiting for her for 3 years

-tell her rumors I wasn't sure about 

-she thinks im lying 

-she loses trust in me

-blocks me on everything

I'm 18, I finished school and now I dont see a single girl in sight. I turned down many great girls all for this one girl. Wasted 3+ years of my sexual, romantic, and love life.
