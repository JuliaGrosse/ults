SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My gf(15) asks me (M16) questions that are really hard to answer. Advice?
POST: For example we will be sitting on the couch after we do sexy stuff(not sex, we're still virgins, but we plan on having sex with each other) and she'll ask me if I'll get bored of her after we have sex and asks if I'll love her forever. I have no idea if I will or not, I don't know what the future holds. I just tell her that I won't get bored of her, but in truth I really don't know. Is there any advice anyone could give on the situation?

Some side info: Relationship for 2 months, she's my first girlfriend, and she is completely head over heels for me.
TL;DR:
