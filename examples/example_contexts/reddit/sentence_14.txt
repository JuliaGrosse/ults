TITLE: Girl [21/F] that I [21/M] was dating is now coming back from abroad, need advice on things going forward.
POST: Throwaway account here, just in case.

So I'm going to be entering my senior year of college this upcoming fall semester. I was dating a girl (we'll call her Julia) for a few months near the end of 2015 and I'd say we really enjoyed being with one another. She then went abroad for the spring semester and said that she thought it would be best if we were both single while she was gone. I had difficulty with it at first, but adjusted and had some casual relationships with different girls over the rest of the school year.

I recently met a different girl [20/F] who I've hit it off with very well (we'll call her Mikaila) and we've talked every single day since we exchanged numbers a few weeks ago. I would love to see where this could go, but the semester has already ended at this point, so I haven't gone forward with it.

It turns out that "Julia" and I are now going to be interning in the same city this summer and I'm not sure I want to restart that relationship as I'm very interested in "Mikaila".  What would be the best way to express this, just be straight up with "Julia" and say that I'm not looking for a relationship and would like to remain single? "Julia" isn't the type that would just be okay with a casual relationship and would want something more meaningful. I just feel like saying this makes me look like a scumbag and I don't want to compromise my friendship with her.
TL;DR:
