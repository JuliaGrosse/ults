TITLE: I [M24] love my gf [F23] but she hasn't fallen yet; deciding to invest longer or play it safe and give up
POST: I've been dating my girlfriend for 7 months now. I've been out of a 6 year relationship for one year now and wasn't planning on anything serious. Neither was she. It was agreed upon to date until we both go to graduate school since we both had plans to move out of state.

She has been by far the best girl I've dated. Everything I could ask for- honest, sweet, fun, the whole deal. We both grew to care way more than we thought we would but its pretty clear I'm a bit more infatuated. That'd be fine, but here's the catch. She has to move in a month. She's stated she would love if I moved with her or even would do long distance until I was able to. What holds me back? She's never been in love before and she gets attached very slowly. I know she cares about me alot but there's alot of things that make me feel like it isn't enough. Maybe I'm just used to having my girlfriend love me from my ex though.

I'd love to go to school where shes going anyways so its not that big of a deal, but it also is. We wouldnt be living together, its just a chance to see how our relationship progresses. I have been in love and I have been hurt before so I'm feeling very guarded about taking such a risk when she may never fall for me (I fell for her trying not to after all!). I also feel like long distance would hurt my chances of her falling for me more and have usually viewed that as doom for relationships.
TL;DR:
