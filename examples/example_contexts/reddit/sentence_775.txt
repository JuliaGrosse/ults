TITLE: TIFU by accidentally committing credit card fraud and ruining a birthday surprise
POST: It's my wife's birthday in 2 weeks so I decided to buy her something really nice. Yesterday while she was out on an errand I snuck out and bought a very expensive Cartier item, making it back home before she got back.

This morning she wakes me up and shows me her phone with a worried look on her face. On it there's a message from her bank warning her that a very large purchase was made on her credit card. I jump out of bed, yelling "what the fuck!" and grab my wallet, finding inside my wife's, identical to my own, credit card rather than my card.

The night before we went to dinner and must have switched our cards after paying. Kinda shocked that Cartier didn't bother to check the name on the card as we have completely different names.
TL;DR:
