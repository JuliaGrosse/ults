TITLE: My girlfriend[19F] Won't have sex with me[18M]
POST: Hey /r/relationships, I think I'm gonna lose my mind. It's been around two years with my girlfriend whom I met in highschool and she refuses to have sex with me. I mean oral sex, feeling up, anything. She does a moderate sex drive and I can turn her on, but she refuses to do anything other than make out.

I honestly love her, but it's making me lose my mind and made me do things I regret(Exchanging pictures). I just don't know what to do, her position seems to be final and I just can't see myself without her. I tried to think about the thought without her and I just couldn't see it; I'm worried that she would find someone else and then end up having sex with them(I know im pathetic). 

Her reasoning for not having sex is due to her religion; she comes from very religious parents, but her siblings are the exact opposite of her. The furthest we've ever gone is me rubbing the outside of her underwear and her giving me a hand job for a minute, then later crying about it to me because she felt "guilty". 

Reddit I dont know what to do. I really dont. I can't see myself without this girl, but she's so prude and it's stressing me out and making me insane.
TL;DR:
