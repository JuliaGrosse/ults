TITLE: How do I (21/M) tell her (20/F) that I'm not sure I'm ready to be in a relationship right now?
POST: Hello everyone!

I just got out of a year long relationship just a couple weeks ago and have since decided it'd be best to stay single for the remainder of my time in college. I graduate in Spring and am not sure where I'm going after, so starting a new relationship probably isn't the best idea right now.

I've been hanging out with a girl I intern with the past couple weeks and it became apparent rather quickly that she liked me. I didn't want to jump the gun and tell her I wasn't interested in dating because I enjoyed her company and didn't think it was anything serious. Our hangouts were pretty much limited to watching movies and eating food so I wasn't too worried that I was leading her on. I was doing what I could to distance myself and not act flirty around her to avoid giving her the wrong idea. Last night, however, as I was getting ready to walk out her door, she grabbed me and kissed me. I didn't exactly hate getting kissed so I didn't do much to stop her. 

I'm not really sure if she is interested in dating me or if she's just looking to have a fling with me so I'm not sure how to proceed. If it's the former, how can I tell her I don't want to be in a relationship?
TL;DR:
