TITLE: Last minute trip to Las Vegas! HELP!!!
POST: So me and my girlfriend (both 23y/o) had a surf trip planned to Costa Rica scheduled for this morning. Unfortunately due to weather the flight was cancelled and there were no other options within the next few days, and since we go back to work on feb 14th, we were kinda screwed. So instead we booked a trip to Las vegas, as the last minute deals were cheap and we thought it would be a fun trip as well! We have decided to rent a car (and because were under 25 they left no holes unpenetrated).

Heres our hastily made itinerary:
feb 6-arrive in vegas at 10am, cruise the strip, gamble a small amount of money, maybe see a show. 
7-Drive to flagstaff, see the wupatki monument, and maybe explore flagstaff (not exactly sure what the plan is for the rest of the day)
8 -Grand canyon, hiking, adventure/explore the canyon
9-rent a bike(not motorized) and try to find some mountain biking spots
10- Head back west->see boulder city/hoover dam
11-zion national park
12- valley of fire
13, plane home leaves at 930am

Were pretty fit, love camping hiking and the outdoors. I am a much bigger fan of natural beauty than architecture.

TL;DR:
