TITLE: Me [20M] with my girlfriend [19F] of two years. She's having a hard time opening up about her problems and concerns. Advice?
POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for around two years. Neither of us are very confrontational, so when a problem arises, it doesn't ever really get mentioned, but sort of just brushed under the rug. I know this isn't healthy, and we're trying to fix it now.

After a near-breakup experience back in February, I've made sure to be better about letting her know when I have a problem, so things are ok on my end. She, on the other hand, is having a difficult time opening up, even by her own admittance. 

When she has a problem, even small, she doesn't talk about it to anyone, and puts up a front to appear okay. The problem stews in her head and worsens her mood, making her mad at every little thing I do, and making her think we're not good together. "Familiarity breeds contempt," so to speak. This eventually led to her rash decision to break up with me for about a week, after which we talked things through and were happily reunited.

So we are now determined to improve on her communication to make our relationship work out, but the problem lies therein: how do we help improve her communication, which is so ingrained in her person? I've agreed to do all I can to ask her about how she's feeling and if she wants to talk, but it's mostly up to her to open up and let me know. So, is there any advice anyone can provide for helping her come out with her problems and talk about them? How can she make it easier on herself to bring up her issues?
