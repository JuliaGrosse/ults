TITLE: My boyfriend has an obnoxious habit of being playfully abusive and it really hurts
POST: Nothing really serious. He thinks he's being playful by hitting, punching, slapping, pinching and twisting my skin. But sometimes it really hurts. He has a really bad habit of twisting my nipples all the time and it gets to a point where it hurts all day. If I ask him to stop he just moves on to other parts of my body. 

Like today he punched my stomach several times (like pretty hard punch) and then pinched my stomach. I am still getting stinging pains on my stomach skin every couple mins from that pinch. How do I get him to stop?
TL;DR:
