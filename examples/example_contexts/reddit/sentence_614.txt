TITLE: [22F] Girlfriend is leaving honeymoon phase and now I [22M] want out
POST: Together for 5 months.  Dated for 2.  I've never been in a relationship longer than ~3 months while she's been a few LTRs.

During the "honeymoon phase" when we made it official between us, we were extra affectionate.  We wanted to see each other every day, would text and Snapchat often, and would have sex all the time.

After a while though, feelings faded.  Hers faster than mine.  Dates became dull.  Texts became less enthusiastic.  Pillow talk after sex would be brief.

She says she's in the comfortable stage.  Where she's secure enough in the relationship that she can be herself.

I was left behind in the honeymoon phase.  I would still get excited to see her.  I miss the sweet texts of "thinking of you".  I miss the pillow talk after sex.

She still tells me she likes me when we're together.  It's gone from "I really really really like you"  to "I like you" though.

Now I want out.  I want another honeymoon phase.  I want her to want me as much as I want her.

Am I looking for too much in a relationship?  It's the first time I've been in a relationship this long.  I understand the honeymoon phase can't last forever.  Maybe I just want a more affectionate girl.  Or that I enjoy the security of knowing she likes me as much as she does.
TL;DR:
