TITLE: TIFU by posting a picture of myself with my sister
POST: A little bit of background, Im 18 [girl] and my sister is 19. We haven't really gotten around to being close because of some personal reasons I won't go intoâ€“ but we basically do not have any idea of what is happening with each other's lives since we never talk.

Anyways, my friends and I decided to go to this huge sport event last Friday. Earlier that day I overheard my sister telling my mum that she is also going, with, of course, her friends. Since both of us were going, I suggested that we should just split a cab to the venue so we can both save $15. On our way to the stadium, she asked me to take a picture of us- I did and because we both thought we look nice in the picture, I decided to post it on Facebook.

On my way home that night, I got a message from this guy we would call Jack.

* Jack: Hey cutie. Whats good?

Jack is one good-looking lad who used to be in my school and my sister's ex-boyfriend. Jack and I never talked and never in a million years did I expect he will talk to me since she dated my sister who may or may not talked shit about me. Tipsy and weirded out, I didn't respond. Not getting the hint, he messaged me again at noon the next day. Still finding the situation weird, I again didn't respond. Jack perhaps saw that I just kept opening his messages, he sent me another...

* Jack: Damn girl don't drop double seens on a brother!

This time I decided to answer for the reason that it seemed like he will just keep bugging me until he gets a message back.

* Me: Hey sorry, was hungover and out of it today.
* Jack: Haha alright sounds like you had an enjoyable time. Do me a favour and hit me up when you feel chill!
* Me: To be fair it was [mentions the sport event]. Ok? Whats up though?

He later then threw out the "are you single?" bomb which officially signals that he is trying to flirt with me... his ex-girlfriend's sister.
TL;DR:
