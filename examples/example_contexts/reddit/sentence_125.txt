TITLE: TIFU by falling asleep
POST: This happened this Easter's Eve. I was at my friend's place with him, and his girlfriend. It was getting late, naturally, I started to doze off. I woke up the next morning before them, and left. Around three o' clock that day I get a call from my friend. He started the conversation with, "Some shit went down last night". Which confused me. All we did was get a little high, and watched Goodfellas. What shit could have possibly gone down? He then tells me that he woke up to me "sleep peeing" on him, and his girl. He told me that he started to get really hot in his dream, he woke up to find the heat source to be my urine. As naturally as I dozed off he punched me in the stomach thinking that would wake me up. Instead of waking up I said, "unlock it", for some reason only the sleep gods know of, and continued to pee. After I finished relieving myself on my friend, his girlfriend, and their bed I walked to where I had passed out, and laid down to continue sleeping. I've always slept walked, and would occasionally sleep walk into my parents room. A handful of times I ended up sleep peeing in their closet, but it hasn't happened since I was around nine years old. This is by far the most embarrassing event in my life so far. For some reason that I'll never be able to wrap my mind around my friend, and his girl weren't mad, in fact they even invited me over the night after I had defiled them in my sleep, and theirs. I didn't accept their invitation due to the fact I won't be able to look them in the eyes for a while.
TL;DR:
