TITLE: [M 20's]y G[F 20's]'s dad[M50's] texted her saying I should "Man up, grow some balls...". How do I handle this situation?
POST: Hi Reddit,

I'll start by saying both me and my gf have been together about a year and are in our early 20's, both still living at home with our parents.

This past weekend my girlfriend and I were hanging out and she was in the middle of an unrelated argument with her dad via text message. He was also unhappy with how much she had been away from home and driving over to my house to hangout rather than me going to her house. He texted her saying "OP should man up, grow some balls, and drive". I wasn't supposed to see the text message but she was reading other messages off to me and they were on the screen. I asked GF if she felt like I didn't drive enough, and I never minded driving to come see her, she said she had no issue with anything. She usually wants to get out of her house, and my house is usually quiet and we have privacy. Whenever I ask her my house or yours she usually wants to come here. I have never had an issue with her dad before this incident but I feel like his words were quite harsh, and told my girlfriend I no longer felt welcome in her parents house, but I would drive and pick her up/drop her off. She told me she understood but hoped with time I would re-evaluate. I told her I know it puts her in a shitty situation and I don't want to strain her relationship with her dad but I felt disrespected and don't want to be around him anymore. I understand that I was never supposed to see that message but saying that behind someone's back is rude. Have I been over sensitive about the whole situation? I'll have to see him again eventually, how do I handle that situation?
TL;DR:
