TITLE: I [M 24] am bad at relationships... this girl ive been dating is amazing, but im worried about the prospects [F 25]
POST: I am a 24 year old grad student who lives 4 hours away from my hometown. 3 weeks ago, I went home and visited some friends and family, and was introduced to a great girl by my buddy, and we really seemed to hit it off. We talked for several hours, from about midnight til 5 am then fell asleep in separate couches right beside each other. We woke up at 630 to keep talking, since i had to leave to drive back for class early that morning. So i got her number, and we went from there, texted alot the first week and two 1hour long phone calls. So labor day weekend rolls around and im able to go home for the break, so i take her out on saturday. We had a great day starting off at the zoo and then going to eat dinner and walk around afterwards. As i thought the date went well and didnt know the next time id be back home, I asked if she wanted to hang out the next day, and she did... we went to see a conservatory of flowers, walked around some more, grabbed dinner, and then went to a ribfest at our local pro football stadium where there were free concerts available. We made out during and after the concert, but we shortly ended our date after that due to time. Anyways, we have continued to txt and call each other and I do want this to evolve into a relationship over time, but is it ok to just meet up once or twice during weekend visits that i make which may only happen 1-2 x per month? There's something about this girl which is different and makes it seems like its worth while, but im trying to make the most of the opportunities i have. We did discuss the future of our dating plans together and said we'd work on meeting as much as possible and take it as it is. Our feelings for one another seem pretty mutual.
TL;DR:
