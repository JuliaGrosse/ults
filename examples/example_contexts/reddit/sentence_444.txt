TITLE: Update: 33m, am I in love or obsessed?
POST: Here's my original post from a couple of weeks ago:  

So things haven't changed.  I'm still in a relationship for now, but somethings have come up.  We had a talk last week where I admitted to her that all I think about with her is sex.  How whenever we get home all I want to do is have sex with her and then just do nothing else.  She asked me if I could be there for her emotionally, and I froze up.  I wanted to tell her no and tell her that I don't think we're going to work, but I didn't really plan on how I would say it, so I just said I would try to be there for her emotionally.  Since I don't really have any other place to stay yet, I chickened out...

Well, this past Saturday we ended up going to see 'Don Jon', and there were things in the movie that I realized I was doing (if you haven't seen it, I'll try not to spoil it for you).  The main thing I brought from it was that I don't "lose" myself in sex with her, but all I want to do is have sex with her.  This is selfishness on my part, but I know that with her all I want to do is the physical act.  I also realized that I would only go out with her on dates because I could count on us having sex when we we got home.  This isn't healthy, and I know it.

So, now I'm at a point that I need to sit down with her and tell her my feelings, but in a way that is respectful.  I know she's going to be upset, mainly since our last breakup was so messy (mainly my fault), but I know it has to be done.  Guess I'm not too worried about her kicking me out other than fact that at the moment I would be homeless, but I can get past that issue somehow.  Guess I'm just needing some tips and advice on how to do this as respectful as possible.
TL;DR:
