SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I[26F] have been in a friends with benefit relationship with someone[26M] since the begining of the summer and he's sending me mixed messages...
POST: So I've been sleeping with this guy since July and after a couple of weeks he told me he liked our relationship the way it was...or basicall that he didnt want nothing serious. I decided I was ok with it so we kept on hooking up. Since the last 2-3 weeks, he comes to my house at least 3-4 times a week and stay overnight. He is really affectionnate and takes care of me like he is my boyfriend. With time I think I developed feelings for him and I brought it up to him last Thursday and he said that he is emotionally not available and that he wouldn't be able to give me what I really want. I did told him about the way he acts with me and the way he takes care of me and he said that's just how he is. My friends think that his feeling for me can change since he actions and words are totally different. I dont want to get hurt...should I have hope that he will change??
TL;DR:
