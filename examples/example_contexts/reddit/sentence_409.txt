TITLE: My[15/M] Dad[47/M] is cheating on Mum[45/F]
POST: Well, I don't really know where to start. We found out a week ago. My dad was at work but he had left his phone at home. A message came through. My sister just read it out of curiosity. We then found messages sent from a random mobile phone number to his saying things like "meet me here/pub" or "can't meet you today at 12", "want a massage? ;P".
We then phoned the number and a woman picked it up. We didn't ask her anything, and put the phone down. We then began adding things up. He had been acting suspisciously for a while now. He would coem back from work and change then go back out. He was getting new clothes, being more aggressive, etc. 
I've never had a good relationship with him. (He abused my mother a lot and said I wasn't his child). He forced her to have an abortion, he is such a piece of shit. I absoloutly hate his guts. Anyway, my sister told my mum today and she phoned him. She said "come home straight, I know what your doing".
His response was to say "OK" and he cut the phone off. I seriously want to plant my fist into his fat head. He tries to keep us under his thumb. I stand up for myself and my family now and he hates it. He says I "talk too much" and "disrespect him". 
My mum just puts up with him, she hardly stands up to him. I just don't know what to do. He makes all the money (my mum has a low wage) so we rely on him. I want a good education etc. but probably won't be able to afford it. I really don't know what to do.
TL;DR:
