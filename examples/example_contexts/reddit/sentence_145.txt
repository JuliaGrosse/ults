TITLE: Why is affirmative action needed in the United States?
POST: **Serious answers please**

Affirmative action benefits select racial/ethnic minorities in the college admissions process over others, particularly those of African, Native American or Latino descent. Affirmative action is intended to promote the opportunities of defined minority groups within a society to give them equal access to that of the privileged majority population and is justified by helping compensate for past discrimination and exploitation.

Handing out diplomas on a gilded platter doesn't seem like the solution to socio-economically disadvantaged groups in the US. It benefits a select few and reinforces negative stigma in all racial groups ( [Check your privilege] ). It would be more effective to rehaul public education ( **NOT** the Common Core!) starting ground up. (Since the synaptic density within the human brain is greatest during elementary and junior high schooling years,  [See critical periods] younger students haven't formed misconceptions about what they can or cannot do, and are more receptive to learning.) 

I have been told (in lieu of my own disappointing college results, and [Kwasi Enin's] very impressive ones) that future success depends more on invested efforts rather than the institution that one attends. Following that logic, AA should have negligible effects on a student's career path and success.

Why, should one student be privileged to pursue education at a top institution that denies another student of comparable academic merit based on different ethno-racial origins?

* **I am not trying to detract from Kwasi's academic merits.**
* **Yes the careers of many prominent individuals, like our President, have been made possible by AA. I don't begrudge that. But the success of a few will not improve the lives of many.
TL;DR:
