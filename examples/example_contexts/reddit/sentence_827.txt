TITLE: Me [13F] with my dad [50M] I like Taylor swift. Whenever I bring her up, he is very mean to me.
POST: This is a really strange problem, I know.

I'm a pretty big Taylor Swift fan. She's a nice persons, she makes good music, she's pretty, and I like her sense of style. I have all of her albums, and recently I got to go to one of her concerts! My older brother got me tickets.

I don't bring Taylor Swift up in everyday conversations because I know not everyone likes her. And I'm cool with that! I don't like one direction, and there's nothing wrong with that. 

But whenever I mention her, my dad gets really mean. My mom was showing me her Instagram because I don't have one and was curious. She had really cute pictures of her and Calvin Harris up. I went "I hope one day I can find a guy that nice! Good for Taylor!" And my dad just went off. I can't remember exactly what he said, but it was along these lines, "Why would you want to be like her? She's a slutty girl who can't sing! You better not be like her!" 

He does this EVERYTIME I mention her. My sister had to drive me to her concert because he wouldn't stop being mean. I just want him to stop!

Thank you in advance for any advice.
