TITLE: How can I give my Gf [F/19] space and make her regret asking me [M/20]
POST: Apologies beforehand if this is an immature question.

So my gf [19] (been together for almost 3 years), her sister [18], a friend [F/20] and me [20] are going to a music festival. I have this problem that whenever we go to places, I'm always on top of her, as in almost glued to her. She asked me if I can giver her space tomorrow so she can hang out with her sister and her friend and I said of course, because that's what a good bf does right? 

Anyways, I do plan on giving her space but I want to know if there is a way to make her regret saying that so she can be stuck on me. It is a little hard to put into words but I just want her to no give me space, basically. Does the "avoid her" trick work in this situation? I just want her to be annoying and glued to me. Apologies beforehand if this is an immature question.
