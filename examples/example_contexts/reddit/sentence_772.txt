TITLE: My [16 F] sister got into my [19 F] Facebook account and read my messages to my SO. I need advice. [Non-Romantic]
POST: After much strife and emotional abuse, I disowned and went no contact with my parents (mom and stepdad) back in September. I put up a 7 page letter, publicly disowning and outing them for the things they had done to me on both of my FB accounts (I have two accounts: one for my family and one for my friends). I expected some sort of retaliation, but... not like this. 

The day after I posted it up, I got a call from a family member saying, that someone from my old family was in my FB account. I didn't know *how* they got in, but I locked them out afterwards, and set up *all* the security measures I could, on all of my accounts.

So, come a few months later, my sister visits me, and I've already assumed it's my biological mother. I get to talking with her and she goes out and *admits* it, proudly, too. She just "wanted to see what was going on".

At first, I felt relief, because it wasn't my biological mother. However, now that the relief is gone, I feel betrayed. Not only did my sister have to know what email I was using, she also had to figure out my 15 character password, which included numbers.

Should I cut off ties with her, or should I just brush it off and forgive her? I'm honestly at a loss.
TL;DR:
