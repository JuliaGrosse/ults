TITLE: I (24f) found flirty texts to a 'Daddy' (46m) on my bfs (25m) phone, maybe one message that hints he may be cheating
POST: In the past few weeks I noticed my boyfriend has sort of withdrawn his phone use in front of me, he used to use it all the time so I thought it was a little odd. Then I had to make a call on it and found it had a password, no prob, I used my own.

However the other day while my boyfriend was showering he was waiting for a call from work so he gave me the password to unlock it in case the call came in while he was showering. I ended up snooping. Typical, I know. 

I looked through his texts, no messages from any women or anything but there was one series of messages to a Daddy. Now I have met my boyfriend's dad and even have his number for emergency reasons, both his parents in fact. Nothing in your face but there were a few messages referring to 'Daddy' as quite handsome and 'Daddy' was complimenting my bf on his eyes. They also talked about stress relief, jacking off a lot, in a way that would seem like a general if weird convo between guys IF I didn't know how my boyfriend is when he's being flirty. Then there was one message from 'Daddy' telling my bf he has a gorgeous looking dick. 

I'm not sure what's going on here, is my boyfriend gay? Bi? Is he cheating? Ready to cheat? Thinking about it? I'm not even sure how I feel about all this. Just confused as fuck, if it had been a woman it would've been easy to just lose my shit over this but I had zero clue my boyfriend liked guys, so I'm way more confused than hurt, though still hurt.

Don't know what to do though?
