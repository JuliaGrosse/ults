SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [20F] have gotten to know [21F] for a few months, I think we're into each other but I can't tell. How do I slyly find out if she's single?
POST: I joined this organization at my college and this girl was in charge of a lot of events for it. I got to know her as an acquaintance and nearly (!) a friend over the past few months. She's really wonderful and I have a huge crush on her. I know she's bisexual, but I don't know if she has a girlfriend or not. 

The strangest part is, I feel like we have some kind of connection. I know it sounds weird but I know there is something between us. I feel like she's into me as well but I don't know if she's single or not. I can't tell from her Facebook whether or not she has a girlfriend, and I don't want to ask. Any advice for finding out if she's available and into me?
TL;DR:
