TITLE: I [17M] am having trouble breaking up with my girlfriend [16F] of nearly two years
POST: I feel like this breakup has been coming for a while. I've had on and off feelings of wanting to break up with her since summer, but until now, they've gone away very quickly. But its not as simple as just breaking up with her, to me. 

My issue is that I don't dislike her in any way, I just dont feel the same sort of attraction I did for the first year or so of being together. I still care for her a ton, and I know that any talk of breaking up, even hypothetically, would send her into a terrible spiral and thats the last thing I want. I'm just not into being romantic with her anymore. 

She also has issues with self-image and self-worth that are going to be hard to avoid, as she's going to bring that up and blame that for the break up, when simply, I just want to be single right now. I miss being free to hang out with my friends whenever I want without feeling obliged to be with her, and I miss my enjoyment of sports that she inadvertently guilts me out of. 

To top that off, I will probably end up losing half my friends over a breakup because their her friends that simply took a liking to me, but we all never got close, so my social life can go in the crapper. 

Any advice whatsoever would help a ton.
