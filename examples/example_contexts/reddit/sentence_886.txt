SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Has she [25/F] started to play games and test me [23/M]?
POST: I've posted a few times in this sub reddit and I have always appreciated the advice you guys give me so here I am asking yet another question. 

I [23/M] have been seeing a [25/F] for a few months now. We are not exclusive but we get along really well, the sex is amazing and we spend as much time as possible together. 

We started getting close a few months ago and it was all playful. We would playfully insult each other and tease each other and that lead to lots of sexual tension. 

She would often text me first and say really nice things and want me to say nice things and it was great. We would text all the time. 

Last Sunday was pretty amazing, we spent the day together and it was just a great experience for both of us. Then Tuesday comes around and it seems like she can't stand me anymore. She is barely replying to my texts, and when she does it always really short stuff like "ok....." and "my day was good thanks". She will take ages to reply to my texts when it used to be instant. We went from about 100 texts a day to about 10 a day in a week. 

She did warn me about a week and a half ago that she would probably try to distance herself because that's what she does when she starts to get close to people. Im not sure if that's what she is doing or if she is just bored of me. 

Maybe I am just insecure or needy, but I just don't understand how you can go from "I get wet thinking about you inside of me" on Monday to barely speaking to me on Tuesday.
TL;DR:
