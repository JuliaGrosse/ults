TITLE: Can an employer refuse to offer a check as payment?
POST: I am trying to find if there is any lawful documentation stating that an employer must offer a check. Right now my company only offers direct deposit as payment, and states simply "they can't" cut a check (and we have a full accounting department that has the ability to physically print checks, so that is not an issue.) 

Normally DD wouldn't be an issue, however, the way the DD works, the payment hits the account nearly 3-5 days after the pay stub is made available, dependent on the bank.

Example:
Pay period is 1st-15th, the 15th falls on a Saturday. The pay stub won't even be processed until the following Monday (17th), then it takes 2-3 business days (this is mostly dependent on the bank at this point) for the money to actually hit the account. 

This happens almost every pay period, and it is even worse when there is a holiday on a Monday, because everything is pushed back even further.
TL;DR:
