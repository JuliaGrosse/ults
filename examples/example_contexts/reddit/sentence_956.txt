TITLE: My ex logs into Skype when I'm online
POST: My ex (39m) and I (25f) dated on and off for 4 years. We broke up a few months ago and it was kinda messy. I said some nasty things to him because I was angry, and he wasn't happy about it. We live a few states away and had a long distance relationship, but he was seeing another chick, and I wasn't happy about that. 

They are now recently engaged, and she just moved into his place this weekend. I don't know how long they have been seeing each other, but I assume it been at least 2 years of them "hanging out" without my knowledge. Not really important, though I suspect he is kinda "settling" for her as a rebound.

Anyway, him and I haven't spoken since around Christmas of last year. I assumed he was over it and moved on. But he has a habit of breaking things off for a few months, and then talking to me again.

I've noticed lately that when I log into Skype, he will suddenly do the same, but never says anything to me. It's weird. Because he only has 2 contacts on his Skype. And I know he doesn't use it to talk to anyone else.

Do you think he's hoping that I'll message him, or is he working up the courage to talk to me? Or am I just being crazy? Please help!
TL;DR:
