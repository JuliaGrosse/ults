TITLE: I (F24) cheated on my boyfriend (M28) of two years. He forgave me but now he's asking if he can sleep with another woman so we're "even" - What do I do?
POST: Two year serious relationship.  I'm a 24 year old female, he's a 28 year old male.

I cheated in the very beginning of our relationship.  It was the first month we were exclusive and I slept with an ex.  This has been my secret for the past two years and the guilt recently overwhelmed me.  So I told my boyfriend what happened.  He was extremely upset with me and almost broke it off.  

It's been a couple of months and our relationship is finally back to normal.  However, last night, he told me he thinks it would be fair if I allowed him to have sex with another woman since I had sex with another man.  

I immediately started crying.  I fucked up so bad.  He said it's not about revenge but I don't understand.  **He's been the perfect boyfriend over the past two years.**  He was faithful, sweet, kind, loving, and now he wants to fuck another girl just because I fucked another guy.

I have a really bad feeling the girl he wants to have sex with is a chick he just met at college.  I haven't met her yet but I get the feeling that's who he wants.  I'm so afraid he's developing feelings for her.

Has anyone ever gone through this?
