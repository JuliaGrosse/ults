SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me (m16) and my gf (f16) are having issues help!
POST: Iv'e been with my girl friend for almost three months and its been strong for a while but then it started having arguments and me getting depressed and wanting to cut.

She gets different around me.. in the mornings and when we sleep together on Skype she is fine but right after school she gets an attitude with me

We start having arguments about little things she just told me that i wouldn't like her messages with her friends because they are all very sexual and dirty and such.. i kinda flipped out saying i'm the boyfriend, you shouldn't be doing that 

Another example, Her and I got together 3 days after her break up with her one year with her ex.. and still today she misses him.. she talks about how much she misses him and wishes she can hear his voice again

I just don't know what to do anymore.. I don't wanna break up with her.. but also im always getting hurt and depressed and cry.

It all makes me feel uncomfortable.
TL;DR:
