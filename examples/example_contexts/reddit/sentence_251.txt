SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My GF [25, F] and I [24, M] live together, but she lost her job and isn't really trying to find a new one. [3 years, 9 months cohabiting]
POST: My GF lost her job 3 weeks ago today. As of this point, to the best of my knowledge, she has only submitted a single resume to a potential employer, despite being home all the time. She didn't even file for her unemployment benefits until Saturday, 19 days after she was let go.

I can afford the rent if she were to be unemployed, but things would be stretched far too thin for me to have any kind of flexibility or free time, as I would be putting in extra overtime.

The fact that she is so seemingly unmotivated to find a job really bothers me, and I don't want to have to support both of us as a young adult who is still establishing his career.

The relationship was somewhat strained before all this happened, but now it is getting to be so much that I am 50/50 on whether or not to continue. If I were to end things, she wouldn't really have a guaranteed place to go - her parents live locally, but her father moved into her room when she moved out, and she would hate to move back in with them anyway, due to major differences in ideals.

So, I'm not sure what I should do. She's not helping herself, and is showing zero initiative in taking her own future under control. She stays at home watching anime and playing WoW. She hasn't taken on any additional chores at the house despite having 50 hours of extra free time a week. What do you guys think?
TL;DR:
