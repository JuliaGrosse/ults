TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?
POST: It seems completely unreasonable to me that if I pay my VAT bill 12 hours late, I am fined almost 100% of the figure for doing so, yet I have just got my tax bill from 2009/10 (it was 40p!), nearly a year late and somehow it's OK for HMRC to just write a limp apology letter.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

Thanks :)
TL;DR:
