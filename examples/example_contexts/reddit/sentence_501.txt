TITLE: I [24M] have been with my girlfriend of 2 years [24F], but I've been unable to get another girl off my mind.
POST: Hello,

I've been with my girlfriend for 2 years now but ever since another girl has entered into my life, it takes all of me to stop thinking of her (we'll call her Nicole) - and for the most part, it's been quite unsuccessful. I found Nicole to be attractive but I always just thought it was going to be just a minor attraction. However, since at least the turn of the year, it's been much harder to claim that it's been just that. Instead, it seems like the thought of her has invaded every free moment in my mind.

No part of me wants to dabble into any sort of infidelity. I love my girlfriend very much and I see a future with her. However, I've been unable to shake the thoughts of Nicole in any way. I've told my girlfriend about Nicole and we almost broke up over it but the relationship survived. I provided the explanation that these thoughts/feelings for Nicole were probably caused by proximity issues.

One of the more major problems with finding an immediate solution to "proximity issues" is that I work with Nicole which means I see her 5 times a week for the majority of my day. Every time she passes by, I instinctively look in her direction, no matter how hard I try not to. I hear her voice all the time and we talk a lot. It's quite difficult to just eliminate her from my work life at the moment.

So I guess I'm writing this to figure out what I can do to stop thinking about her. As mentioned above, I would like to stay with my girlfriend. And as far as I could ascertain, Nicole and I are probably incompatible so it's not something I want to pursue. What should I do to erase her presence in my mind?
TL;DR:
