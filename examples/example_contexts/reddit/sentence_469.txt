SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [36 M] with my wife [36 F] (married a year, been together 6 years): She wants to have a gay guy friend come over and sleep in our bed and cuddle with her while I'm out of town. I got weird about it. Am I being unreasonable?
POST: I know and met the guy. He's a nice guy.  You would never guess him to be gay in any way. He and my wife clicked right away.

Anyway, we don't know him *that* well. We've hung out maybe 4 times. My wife asked me right out if I would care if he came over when I was out of town and slept with her.  Said there was nothing wrong with cuddling with a gay man. Actually went on to say that she could have a full-on emotional relationship with someone without it being sexual (which geez kinda sounds like an emotional affair to me).

So I got weird about it.  Not sure why exactly, but I'm not comfortable with another guy in my bed with my wife when I'm not there. Gay or straight.  Perhaps it's worth mentioning that he was straight most of his life. Perhaps it isn't.

The thing that bothers me most is that she didn't say "Ok, thank you for sharing your boundary with me. I wont push the issue."  -- She *did* push the issue. Argued as to why I was wrong about it. Brought up past relationships of mine when I was with "more alternative people" and called me "vanilla."  The whole exchange left me seething for  a myriad of reasons beyond the original discussion. I began to feel as if my feelings (even if they WERE old school or unreasonable) were Invalid. Never a good feel.

What's your take?  Am I being unreasonable about the whole thing? Would you let a gay man sleep and cuddle in your bed with your wife while you weren't there? Why or why not? What if the tables were turned? For the ladies out there, would you let your husband sleep and cuddle with a gay woman while you were out of town? Thank you in advance.
TL;DR:
