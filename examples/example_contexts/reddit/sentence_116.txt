TITLE: Looking for some advice on sex with my girlfriend.
POST: Hey TwoX, I kind of would like your opinion or advice. Throw away because well, Incredibly personal.
My girlfriend and I have been dating for a few months, And we've only had sex once. When we started dating, Were totally open with eachother and she told me she'd only had sex one time, And So I was completely fine with waiting. On halloween though, She was excited to give it a try, Bought lingerie, We rented a hotel room while we were out of town partying, And long story short, We tried to have sex.
Here's the problem, While we did sort of have sex, And I tried to do as much foreplay to make her comfortable and enjoy herself as possible, She didn't seem into it. When it actually happened it was more of a, her wincing alot and me asking alot if she was ok, And when she'd wince i'd try to pull out, And she'd try to pull me in, But afterwards she confided that all it did was hurt. She even said it hurt for two days after the fact.
Now i'm completely ok with waiting as long as she wants or needs to. I'm not dating her because I want to have sex with her, I'm dating her because she's an amazing beautiful individual, Both mentally and Physically, And ever since we got together everything just kind of makes a bit more sense. She's fantastic, Honestly the girl of my dreams.
But I also worry, Because we had a talk and she said she is kind of scared or nervous to try again, And while I would wait, well, forever. I do worry that not having a healthy sexual relationship might sooner or later cause some problems, So here I am for advice, with a few questions.
What's your opinion on the situation?, And if any of you have experienced the same sort of situation or feelings of physical pain, What did you do to get past them? Should I be worried about this situation at all?
TL;DR:
