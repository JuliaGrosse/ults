TITLE: Don't have any empathy after I injure myself working for you, guess I'll follow the doctors advice to the letter

So 2 months ago to the date I injured myself at work twice in the same week. As a result I've spent 4 weeks off work and have been seeing a physiotherapist daily since.  Now it's bad enough when you imply I am faking it and I should suck it up in conversations even thought the m ore serious of the 2 accidents was caught on camera. So company policy is heartless and 4 day after being out on leave my private insurance will be cut since I'm no longer working. Dick move but I can live with that. But once I do come back to work and you write me up because I'm not smiling and looking happy.(I don't know about you guys but happy and smiling is probably not even in the top 50 words I would use to des rube someone in constant pain.) Then you threaten to dock me the time I spend icing my injuries from my pay and complain that working 3 hour shifts to accommodate my physio is a problem and mention you won't be able to give me hours if I can't do 4 hour shifts. That's when we have a real problem.  
  
  
Does it surprise when after my last doctors visit I have a medical note saying I can only work 3 hour shifts 3 times a week. And another stating I have to ice each injury for 15 minutes every 90 minutes. So I guess I now have to punch in and Ice myself for 30 minutes work for 90 minutes then reapply ice for another 30 minutes then work the last 30 minutes. That's so much better than when all I asked for was to ice myself half way through my shift.
TL;DR:
