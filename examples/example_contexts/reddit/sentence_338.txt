TITLE: Have any of had a successful, long-term relationship that began with glances across a room?
POST: Met a potential client for coffee today in a public coffee shop. Passed a [re: gorgeous] guy putting sugar in his coffee, made eye contact, smiled, and continued to the counter to order my coffee. 

Then I joined my client-to-be and proceeded to discuss business with him for 45 minutes, all the while, hot guy walked to and from his car loading food he'd had catered from the chain cafe...making eye contact with me each time he walked behind my guest. And all I could think was "damn, if only I wasn't in a meeting, I could say hi to him."

Finally, he pretended to casually "overhear" something in our conversation, joined it for about one minute, exchanged cards with both of us, and left. I got a call from him an hour later. (Note: very attractive). We've been texting back and forth all day.

What a chance meeting! I just saw him across a room. Have any of you had successful relationships that began this way?
TL;DR:
