TITLE: How do I [27f] return my exBF[29M]'s things?
POST: My ex bf and i broke up a month ago. I begged for a week, then went no contact after. Before i went nc, we had a fight on how i would return his ipad back. He wanted me to mail it, i wanted to meet up.

So now, after weeks of nc, i decided not to meet up. He was a jerk. He treated me like crap after break up and he was really mean and insulting. 

He made me unfriend all his family and he unfriended our mutual friends. Even his college friend who had initially set us up. This college friend is husband of my friend.

My friends told me not to contact him and wait for him to contact me if he wants to get his ipad back. I really dont want to contact him too, but i dont want him to think that i dont want to return his ipad. My friends dont want to give him his ipad because they are pissed off at him cause they think he is immature. 

So what do i do? Do i wait for him to contact me? Or should i just text him a short message asking for his address? 

I feel like i will lose the last of my dignity if i contact him first. Going no contact has helped me a lot because after begging i felt like i lost my pride. But im afraid that he might text me something nasty saying why dont i want to return his ipad. But i am really just waiting for him to contact me first. 

He had been working abroad and just came back last week i think.
TL;DR:
