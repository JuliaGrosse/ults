SUBREDDIT: r/self
TITLE: Made an ass out of myself while on acid, now my best friend isn't talking to me anymore
POST: About a month ago my good friend and I decided to trip before classes started back up. This was my 3rd time with psychedelics so I knew what to expect, however we took a larger dose than what I've done before. We went out and biked a bit but had his girlfriend pick us up after we started to feel dehydrated. We went back to his place and that's where things got weird

Basically I went into a dream-like state where I didn't know what was real and what was fake. I started humping his sink and tried to start a threesome with him and his girlfriend, among other things (this was all told to me once I sobered up). His gf eventually took my phone and texted my brother, acting like it was me texting, telling him to come pick me up.

Eventually after I exited the alternate universe I had to ask my roommate how I got back to the apartment and what the fuck happened.

Sent my friend a message asking him "what's up dawg?" later that night and he didn't respond. A mutual friend stopped by to check up on me, as he had been texting with the friend I tripped with. Told him my story and found out then my best friend was really pissed at me.

Over the course of the next day I told my best friend how I couldn't control myself and didn't know what the fuck was going on, but he didn't buy it. Maybe because he was thinking a little clearer than I was at the time so therefore I could think just the same as him?

So here I am a month later with him ignoring anything I send him. We normally would hang out every weekend if not more, so I've sent him messages asking if he was busy and wanted to talk/hang the past few weekends. At first he would say he's busy with work or homework, but now he isn't even responding.

Not sure if I should just give up on the friendship or try another route of saving what (I thought) was a really strong bond
TL;DR:
