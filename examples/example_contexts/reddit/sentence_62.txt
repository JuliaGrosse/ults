TITLE: in a relationship someone who suffers from depression. putting stess on my happiness. is this a healthy relationship?
POST: I (M17) am in a relationship with my GF (F17). We have been dating for 2 years. Over time her emtional and mental issues have become more apparent. She has horrible self confidence issues, horrible mother/daughter relationship, and lots of other Type-A depression symptoms. Obviously this puts stress on me. I try to make her happy, tell her she beautiful, everything you can do. And none of it helps. She is very unloving and self centered concerning her own issues.
DESPITE all of this: I love her. I really do. When she is happy she is amazing. 
And I want to help and be there for her more than anything.

The question is: is it healthy for me to be in a relationship with a person who suffers from depression?
TL;DR:
