TITLE: Looking for advice on my house. When do I stop paying?
POST: I'll try to keep this short. My wife and I Bought the house in 2007 at the time it was valued ~135,000, we bought it for 126,900 at 6.25%. We have been wanting to move for the last 4 years but after 2008 we have of course been underwater. Last year I spent most of the year trying to sell the house as it looked like the market was improving a little. 

What I didn't know is houses in my particular subdivision were slowly being bought out and turned into rentals. This combined with foreclosures made it so FHA will no longer approve loans for the neighborhood. At this point after talking to multiple people it became clear my only real options were to do a short sale or get foreclosed on myself. (If anyone has any other suggestions or paths please say so)

We have been waiting for Wells Fargo to approve the short sale since December. Our finances are draining monthly, even if we could afford it we no longer want to live here as it doesn't feel safe anymore. We have had the house broken into and things stolen, as well as a car stolen out of the driveway, packages taken, mail tampered with, dog poop smeared on the side of our truck... the house is valued at 75,000 now, we still owe 107,000.
TL;DR:
