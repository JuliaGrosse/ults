SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I only ever do things to make my girlfriend happy even if it means myself being unhappy. Advice please?
POST: Me and my girlfriend have been together for 18 months and I feel like I only ever do things that she wants and not what I want. She is scared of me going out with mates incase I cheat on her (maybe because her previous boyfriend did?) or do drugs even though I have countlessly promised we that would never happen. I love her very much and with all my heart. I just don't feel in a happy and secure relationship anymore. She is very controlling although I would never tell her that.  I want her to trust me, what can you do to make a girl trust you more?
TL;DR:
