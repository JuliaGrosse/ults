TITLE: Me [20M] with my girlfriend [19 F] 2 years high school and a year in college with a short break in between, lack of trust and communication
POST: We dated junior and senior year of high school and through the summer before I started college before taking a short break. During this break she began dating my best friend. I was devasted and the friendship was lost. After a month she realized her mistake and broke that off and we began talking again.

Since then we have been a fling for the last year and some change. We have never made it official because she said she didn't want that commitment yet. I planned on dealing with this because I love her. Recently her communication has been less than stellar. I began worrying and decided to investigate.

I created a fake Twitter account and was able to DM her asking about a date hoping to get a no right away. After not replying for a few hours she began asking questions trying to get to know the fake person. I asked if she was with any guys and she said she had just broken something off. She also said she wanted to take it slow. At this point I'm distraught and decide to go see her. She acts like everything is ok until I confront her about the messages. 

She inmediately gets pissed and starts saying she can't believe I catfished her and that I was crazy for doing so. I asked her to see it from my point of view but she refused to finish the conversation. She said she was just playing along to see if it was real and was about to say no when I went to talk to her. I just don't know what to think or do.
TL;DR:
