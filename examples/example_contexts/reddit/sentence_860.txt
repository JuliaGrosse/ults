SUBREDDIT: r/Advice
TITLE: My online friend is in love with me and I don't know what to do.
POST: I don't use this account much but basically, I'm a kid with alot of anxiety and the things you'd expect of a teen.. I like to seek online friends to play games with and just talk to, you know? Some of my best friends are online, that's just the way I like to know people, and one of my best friends is a girl my age who we will call Kaley. Kaley and I have known each other for 4 years, when we met we were still just little kids playing Minecraft.. but lately we've been talking more and things got weird.

We've video chatted occasionally and the past few weeks she's been calling me cute and stuff and just laughing it off after (nobody had ever really complimented me before so it caught me off guard). She then proceeded to get more and more flirty and our conversations evolved from just banter to some more emotional and heavy conversations about our lives and I think my reaction to these things led her to believe I liked her too.. then yesterday she texted me one thing and hasn't been online since:

"I'm in love with you"

Now here's the thing.. It'ds not like I *dont* find her attractive, I really do and if I knew her in real life I would've been ecstatic, but we're high school students who live on different sides of the country (Texas, New Jersey), and even though I do kind of like this girl back, a real relationship just isn't possible right now, and I don't know if it's possible to go back to being friends now.

I don't know how coherent this post is, I've always been really bad at putting my thoughts into words.
TL;DR:
