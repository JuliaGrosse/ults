SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining
TITLE: My dog is having trouble with any new tricks, please help!
POST: So I have a one year old golden retriever who is having trouble learning any new tricks. When I first got him, at 8 weeks, I taught him the basics (sit, down, stay) and manners. Then, I thought touch (with his nose) would be a fun trick to teach, and it was. Until now. Now, whenever I do anything, he tries to touch it and won't learn anything else really.

After I taught him those first 4 tricks, I got lazy and really stopped working on anything besides manners and those 4 tricks. He really doesn't even lay down without a hand signal for some reason. 

How do I work through this? I really would love to work on a lot of tricks, but he really won't stop touching me hand whenever I try to lure him (and I mean like jerk touching, not nice luring).
TL;DR:
