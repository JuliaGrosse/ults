TITLE: My Dad told me that his marriage isn't going to last my freshman year.
POST: Hello Reddit. I'm thirteen. As you can see by the title, my Dad doesn't preferably like my mother. I call her my mother because I don't particularly like her either. In fact, I hate her. Plain and simple. It's not that teen angst or anything. She's just rude and abusive. I mean, she absolutely hates our new puppy. She doesn't understand violence isn't the answer. My Dad has taught me that since I was little. I never provoked fights with my sibling. She hits my puppy when the puppy just wants to play. Of course this just makes the puppy mad. Don't get me wrong, the puppy is really good. She only does her business in the house when nobody's paying attention to her. My Dad and I watch the puppy when we're home. When my mother and sibling are home. They pay no attention to her. She pees and craps on the floor like it's nobody's business. Also, my mother has no job. My Dad keeps our family afloat. If they get into a custody battle (which is likely) I want the ability to testify to my own choice. I should be old enough by then to do so. My Dad said to me he's keeping the dog though. Which is good, I love that little puppy.
TL;DR:
