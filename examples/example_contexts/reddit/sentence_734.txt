TITLE: I want to make this work. Wondering if it's a lost cause.
POST: Him 25 Me 22 
Been together for a little longer than a year and we're moving in together in about a month. 

We are both madly in love with each other and never felt this way about anyone else. We have our issues, but overall our relationship makes us both very happy. 

The problem is that I have insecurity issues stemming back to my childhood that I have continuously tried to work on. It is hard for me to get close to people so I make everyone disposable. I've been lied to by people and taken advantage of in my past so I am paranoid and can be really cynical and skeptic. I have acute anxiety and it acts up at times and makes me paranoid and I have compulsive thoughts about him lying or being unfaithful. 

My current SO does not give me reasons to doubt him and he never has but I am having trouble giving him my complete and total trust. I get paranoid and although I do give him his space and do not text him 24 7 or question him at all times there are moments when it gets the best of me and I start feeling paranoid and extremely insecure. I love him to pieces and I want this to work. We're both in a place where moving in together is right and we both feel so ready for it (I have been living with him as a transition for the past few weeks and everything is going great.) The only problem is those moments of lack of trust and I know it is not fair to him that I sometimes doubt his love for me. I am working on it/have been and it is getting better, but I am losing hope and starting to worry that I will never be able to give him my complete and total trust. 

Do you guys have any similar experiences or words of advice for me? We tell each other everything I am just so terrified of the fact that there is a possibility (because this is real life) that he may one day lie to me. I want to get over this for him because he doesn't deserve it.
TL;DR:
