TITLE: Me [29f], husband [31m] losing weight fast, obsessed with weightloss products, suspended from work over Internet use (regarding this), is there any future in our relationship?
POST: I'm on a throwaway, since my sister has an account here.

Newlywed, been married 6 months now. For the past 6 weeks, my husband's been losing weight, he's been refusing to eat, or eats very little, spends hours on the 'net reading about weight loss treatments or how to lose weight.

He was suspended from work on Tuesday for 2 weeks for misuse of Internet, he admitted to buying weightloss drugs online, using the company Internet, he's got to go into a meeting on Monday to discuss this.

His libido seemsto have gone, doesn't want sex, just spends hours and hours exercising, sits obsessing on the iPad over weight loss treatments, has even worn one of my bikinis whilst taking selfies - he claims its so he can see his weight loss in action. I found 20 selfies of him in a pink bikini of mine.

I asked him last night why he's so into this weight loss and he said "I'm fat, fat, faaaat, I'M A fat idiot who needs to lose some weight, I stink, I suck at being good, if you know what I mean."

I think he means being healthy when he talks about being good.

Then I asked him if he'd go for counselling with me and he said "God, no, counselling, they're just trying to push their views on you about being fat. Its a con."

I found him online at 8 this morning using our credit card to order some Cialis and weightloss pills, we argued over it and he told me "i'm fat youre gonna fucking lose it that i used our credit card but what the hell."

I feel like his weight loss and obsession with losing weight is turning him into someone else and am not likeing it.

So, any advice on how to deal with this further?

I know i could divorce him, but isnt it too early, and marriage has bad times as well as good to work through?

Needing help... and its welcomed a lot!
