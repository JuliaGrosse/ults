TITLE: Can my boss take money out of my paycheck if I'm not going against my contract?
POST: So I'm quitting my job and gave my two week notice to my boss. I offered to stay longer than two weeks but he seems to not care about when I go. In my contract, I get 8 paid days off. I have only taken 6 so far. I told my boss today that I have not used all my paid days off and would like to use the remaining two next week. His response was that he doesn't want to pay for my vacation since I'm leaving on short notice. I'm not leaving on short notice-- two weeks is protocol everywhere. There is nothing in my contract that says it has to be approved, whether those days are sick or vacation, etc. It literally just says "8 paid sick and personal". So if I do just wing it and take my days off, can he take it out of my paycheck?
TL;DR:
