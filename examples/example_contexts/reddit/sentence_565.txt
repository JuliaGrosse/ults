TITLE: TIFU by letting a hooker into a hotel and giving her a random roomnumber
POST: NOTE: This happened a few months ago but just thought about sharing it here now.
So I was in Bruxelles on a trip with my school. We were a few classes from my grade. I lived in a room with three of my classmates, we had been there for a few days and were having a blast. The night in focus I ran down to a mini-mart for some snacks, when I returned a big black BMW was parked right infront of the entrance, and as I'm sliding my keycard to unlock the door, this plastic-filled has-been of a woman jumps out of the car and start to ramble in French. I explained I don't speak French and tried to get in before she said anything, but she walks right behind me, still talking. She finally understandood, and asked if I was the one who had called her. I just wanted to get her away from me, so without thinking I said "It wasn't me, it was room 37". Instantly knowing this was gonna fuck up someones night. She thanked me and jumped in the elevator. I sprinted up the stairs and into my room, and pretended nothing had happened.
My god the following that happened I did not see coming.
A few minutes after I had got to my room, loud yelling started from a floor below. The room I had send the hooker to, was some from one of the other classes, and their teachers went apeshit on them, and they were send home the next day.
I still haven't said anything, and I probably never will knowing that they had to go to special classes every sunday from then til now, and they are not allowed to come with us next year, when we go to Scotland.
