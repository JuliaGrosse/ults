SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I[20m] got really drunk one night and my ex came onto me, I kept saying no but eventually gave in. I told my girlfriend [18f] about it the next day and we talked it through. We're still together but I need advice.
POST: Before any of you tell me, I know that I'm scum for cheating. I feel absolutely awful. I hate myself for it. I haven't eaten anything in 2 days and yesterday had to fight the urge to drive off the road because I can't stand myself. 
Me[20m] and my long distance girlfriend [18f] have been together for 4 months but I truly believe she's the one. I don't know why I cheated and I hate myself for it. She's giving me a second chance but I desperately need advice on what I can do that will help her believe that it will never happen again. I don't know how to gain her trust back and make her believe what I say again.
TL;DR:
