TITLE: I [25F] just want to have sex, but my boyfriend [25M] is all over the place! What should I do?
POST: My boyfriend and I are both super busy people, but we make time for each other and spend a great amount of quality time together. That's amazing, but we don't have sex as much as I'd like. 

We have a lot in common, but there is one thing we just don't agree on: spontaneity. He thinks being spontaneous is randomly having sex whenever (one week we won't have sex at all, the next week we'll be on each other for hours everyday). I think it's having sex consistently, but not necessarily in the same way or in the same place.

This is doing a number on our sex life--at least for me. The problem is, I get used to having sex alllllll the time and then he pulls away for 2-3 weeks and I get sexually frustrated. 

This happens partly because of him wanting to be "spontaneous" and partly because of his workload. If he has a ton of things to do, we won't have sex because he is constantly on the go (traveling, recording in our home studio, etc). But on his days off, he can't keep his hands off of me. 

We've talked about it numerous of times and I kinda get it, but I still wish there was more balance in our sex life. That week of two-a-day sex sessions is AMAZING...until I realize that there's two or three weeks of "drought" ahead of me. 

I can masturbate, and I do, but I love sex because of the passion and intimacy. I really, really miss experiencing that...consistently. What should I do about this situation? Thanks!
