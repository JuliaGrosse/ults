TITLE: Ladies, have you ever been dating a new person and kissed someone else?
POST: Hi, so the title speaks for itself. Have you ever been dating a guy and kissed someone else? Why did you do it and what did it mean to you?

I (M22) recently started dating this girl (F22) we had been on a few dates and things were going well then she had to go out of town for a few weeks. We talked everyday while she was gone and then a few days ago she told me she had kissed another guy on her last day out of town. Before she left we had talked about how we both like each other and we don't want to see anyone else and she says she was drunk and immediately regretted it. I know I need to make a decision myself on what to do but I was just looking for some input from people who have been in a similar situation.
TL;DR:
