TITLE: I [24M] had a drunken semi-hookup with a friend [22F] that I really like, but the catch is she has a bf[19M].
POST: Am I wrong for thinking that there is something between us? I am calling this a semi-hookup because it only went to 3rd base. We have been friends for a couple months. We have been hanging out for a while and Saturday night we got rather drunk at a friend's house. Neither of us could drive so we slept on an air mattress.  Shortly after laying down the fooling around commenced. It went on for about half an hour then we both kind of had an "oh shit" moment when we realized what we were doing.  We sat down outside to sober up and had one of the most personal and meaningful conversations I have had with another person in years.(She also expressed her enjoyment with the conversation) We go back inside and I lay back down on the air mattress and she got back into bed with me. Nothing else happened but we cuddled up and talked for another couple hours.  Next day, she says that we are equally at fault for the incident but she doesn't want to tell her bf because she is afraid to hurt his feelings. I am beyond confused with the entire situation.
TL;DR:
