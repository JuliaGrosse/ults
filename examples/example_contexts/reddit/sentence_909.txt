TITLE: Current job allows for flexibility during work hours and subsidizes travel - looking for a side hustle. Whatcha got, PF?
POST: So I recently started a job that has me largely working from home and driving around my metro area. It's a sales job, so I'm paid mileage(when on appointments) and a stipend for my vehicle. I'm going to need to upgrade my car before too terribly long, and I want to put down a significant amount. I'd like to put together the cash for this payment from funds earned through a side gig. Not so much because I couldn't manage to save the cash myself, more as a project and a way to keep myself productive.

Given my unique job situation, I'm able to carve out time here and there during business days and also have some of the costs of travel subsidized so it seems wise to take advantage of that. At the moment I don't have any productive hobbies, unfortunately. My first thought was Uber, but I think that would make it way easier to get caught "double dipping". My first venture is going to be thrifting and reselling 100% wool jackets/suits on CL and offering delivery for a small additional fee. I live near an affluent suburb, so I think I could keep a pretty decent inventory on hand and I don't think the time investment will get to be too daunting once I have a couple of templates for listing completed. Any other ideas or pitfalls/opportunities I'm not considering right now? What do you do for additional income?
TL;DR:
