SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [19 M], will be stuck on a farm with my [20 F] girlfriend's ex-girlfriend [19(?) F] all summer.
POST: I'm a college student, and about a month ago I entered into a long-distance relationship (and my first relationship in general) with a girl I met on Facebook a year ago. (I realize that that in itself is strange, but things are going quite well so far, so I'm not worried about it). 

I wound up applying to intern on a sustainable farm this summer, and got accepted. When I got the acceptance email, however, I discovered that my girlfriend's ex (who goes to the same school as I do) will also be interning there.

So basically, I'm going to be stuck all summer at a tiny farm with my girlfriend's ex. There are a total of four interns there, so I can't really avoid her. The thing is, she doesn't know that my gf and I are together. Should I tell her beforehand, and if so, how? Or am I better off just keeping things a secret?
TL;DR:
