TITLE: Adjusting to new job, regret leaving old one
POST: I just recently got promoted (yay) as a trainee for a job. I prefer not to say what industry it is in. To get this job I had to transfer work locations (same industry) leaving behind a lot of friends. The place I used to work at was great, I had been there 6 years. 

My new work location I expected to be very similar, similar crews and routine. However I just met the crew and was totally shocked. It's completely different, what is bothering me the most is everyone is segregated to themselves. I hate the atmosphere compared to my old job. Even at lunch everyone separates. I seriously regret the transfer right now. I could have pursued the same position at my old work location but unfortunately the place is planned to shut down and I have a long career to think about.

How did you adjust to your new position? Did it take long? I could go back but that would entail being a quitter, potentially leaving me not able to pursue this position ever again, and also risking my career length as I could lose my job eventually at the old location (not likely, but not unlikely either). Has anyone ever beein in a similar situation and stayed or left, how do you feel about your choice?
TL;DR:
