TITLE: Help, please. M(26)y WiF(25)e and I just looked at our wedding photos and she hates them.
POST: So my wife and I have been married for two months and we just got our first look at our wedding photos.  She hates them.  My wife feels like there are a ton of photos of my family and hardly any of her's, in truth our photographer did appear to focus on my family.  In addition, she felt like a lot of the pictures didn't look as "professional" as she was expecting (i.e., bad lighting, our stances look forced, bad positioning of flowers and whatnot, very few photos of guest and other family, pictures of the photographers daughters at the wedding mixed with the wedding party, etc.).

The photographer in question is someone we know through our church.  My father is also the pastor of said church so bringing up our displeasure would cause a lot of drama we would prefer to avoid, if possible.  If necessary we will talk to our photographer like adults, but, in my experience, being a pastor's son can make it difficult to keep my issues centered on me and not somehow transferred onto my dad. That was a long way of saying I'm looking for a solution where I can do something special for my wife and keep it between us and family.

My wife has a, "I don't want to talk about it because there is nothing to do about it" mentality right now.  Even now she is in a bit of a quiet rage at the other end of out couch.  I'm looking for a possible solution of something I could do that would help ease her anger and, hopefully, make up for some of the bad photos.  Obviously I can't go back in time and getting all that family together again would be incredibly difficult but I'm willing to hear all advise and ideas.  Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any ideas of what I can do to help make this better?
TL;DR:
