TITLE: Me [F/19] with my SO [22/M] of 1.5 years-what's the most sensitive way to bring up his weight gain?
POST: My boyfriend was extremely fit and muscular when I met him. Due to an injury he sustained in the fall and lack of exercise in the summer, he's gained at least 25 lbs.

So with all the other posts I've read on this topic, the advice is usually to be active together, start cooking together, etc. the issue with this is he can't do very many active things because of his injury and he can't get surgery to fix it for several more months. We could try cooking together, except we have opposite schedules, I'm a vegetarian he is not, various confounding factors. 

So I guess the solution is to have a conversation about my losing attraction and maybe how he should change his eating habits? I suppose we could start doing low impact exercise, he has mentioned swimming. I just don't know if it's worth issuing an ultimatum, but it's terrible not being attracted to him anymore and I feel really shallow. Any other ideas on how I can bring this up/how we can face it is a couple?
TL;DR:
