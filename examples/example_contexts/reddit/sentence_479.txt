TITLE: [20/M] first time going on a date with another man. I cant shake the anxiety and don't know what to expect
POST: I'm sure I am over analyzing everything about this interaction but I know that talking to some strangers with experience could at the very least calm my anxiety. I'm sorry if the way I say anything offends anyone, I have almost no experience with the gay community and I feel like I have been repressing these feelings for a long, long time because of my upbringing. I am in college now and have been living away from my very religious parents for two years, though I've known I am bi for a lot longer.

I met him [21] on tinder and we flirted a bit (he seems to be a super nice guy, we have a lot in common, and he has been very flattering). We have a coffee date ~~tomorrow~~ Wednesday and I don't expect things to go anywhere really but is there anything I should know? I feel like a fish out of water since I don't have any gay friends I can ask for advice. 

 * Any men who have gone from dating women to men; is there anything overarchingly different about it? 
 * Is there anything I should know beforehand about the sex?
 * I'm not even that experienced with dating in general (I was in a 6 year LTR that ended a few months ago) so just general tips would be appreciated.
 * I am planning on telling him of my inexperience pretty early on, is that the best idea and whats the best way to bring that up? I don't want to make him feel like this is just an experiment to me
TL;DR:
