TITLE: unique situation with girl in class; originally posted in TIFU
POST: Recently I have lost a little confidence in myself because of a bad break up and a move to a new town. I am going to sound like a douche bag for a second but stay with me, trying to give other users the full picture. I am a charismatic, charming, and decently good-looking 26 year old male college student. How do I know that? I have been with a lot of quality girls over the years (some relationships, some a few-night stands). I have never had trouble making friends, etc.  I take a class with one girl in particular who I identified from day one as my type. My type is natural beauties, slightly on the hippie side with brains. I cannot stand dumb, material girls (or people in general). One friday night I hit this girl up for some smoke and she tells me to come over whenever. I did some laundry, cleaned up and voila, two hours later im ready to go. I get to her place, she takes me back to her room, we listen to some albums, smoke a joint and talked about our lives-where we came from, our families, etc. I have never been really great at picking up vibes other than if a girl is irritated. At this point its almost 2 am. I decided it was a critical moment, either ask if she wanted me to stay or take the reigns and say I was going home (quit while I'm ahead). I chose the latter. Over the weekend I was busy so we didnt talk. Today (Tuesday) comes around and we had class. I asked her if she wanted to come to my place wednesday after class and she said definitely. So I guess my question is do I go for it this time? Its worth mentioning she is several years younger than I am (can count the difference on one hand). Also I am not looking for another relationship, just a chick to kill time with for the next couple of months; I get the impression she is the same way in light of our conversations. Preferably seeking like-girls advice.
