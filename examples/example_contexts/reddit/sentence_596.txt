TITLE: [20M]How to bounce back?
POST: Back story: It's been awhile since I was out and about (school and work always tied me up). I haven't found a girl I connected with and I had been feeling a bit lonely, but didn't really mind. I finally got my schedule under control and met a girl through some school events. She seemed nice and overall we connected well. 

We were friends first, I went over to play video games and such (her college is only an hour away from where I'm at) and so forth. Eventually I developed feelings for her and after further conversation she developed some for me. I took her out to a nice dinner and we really enjoyed it. This past week I haven't really been able to talk to her because I've been studying hard for some exams, although I manage to have small chats every now and again. 

We've been talking about a second date and things are overall going great. 

I called her about an hour ago and her phone vibrates (it's deafening at times) and I ask who just killed my ears to which she calmly replies "oh, just my boyfriend." 

*whoa whoa whoa, I thought she was into me?! *

Nope. Turns out she just got back together with her ex the day before I'm going to take her out to a great second date, now I have some nice flowers and a table for two for myself. Self-esteem kind of went down and

 I don't know if I should address it or what.
TL;DR:
