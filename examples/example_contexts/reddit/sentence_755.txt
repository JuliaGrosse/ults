TITLE: Bleeding during/after plane flight normal?
POST: I'm a 24 year old male, and this isn't my first time on am airplane. I've been on airplanes 6 times prior to yesterday, and never had an issue. Yesterday I took 2 airplanes... One from NY to Atlanta, Georgia. Then again from Georgia to Guatemala. When I was boarding the 2nd plane, before it took off, 2 drops of blood fell from my nose... I pulled my head up and it went away. At the end of the 3 hour flight, when I bent over to get my carry on bag, my nose just started pouring blood quickly. My clothes were damaged, my hand was literally covered in red, and it made a scene as everyone saw what happened.Also later on that night, more than 12 hours after flight, and after 5 or so hours of sleep I bled again, but only a bit.
TL;DR:
