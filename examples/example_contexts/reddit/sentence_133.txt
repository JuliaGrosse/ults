TITLE: [31 M] paranoid with gf [30F] 3mths. Sends an email which never arrives. Sobers up, won't tell me what's in it
POST: She goes away on holiday. The morning she's due to come home she texts saying she's drunk and horny can't wait to get home and may need to have sex in the airport. Brilliant. Followed by a text saying that she has sent me an email which I should read before I pick her up. No email arrives. She replies later 'probably just as well!' I say she could just copy&paste into a msg but she doesn't reply.  
  
Anyway, she was drunk and while I got those messages in the middle of the night, later on in the day, I'm still a bit curious. So I text and ask and she replies but ignores the curiosity.  
I pick her up at the airport, and though she travelled with a big group of friends (about 10, mostly all couples), she's on her own and her eyes are bloodshot. She's obviously tired but I feel she's a bit distant - like she won't let me push the trolley for her.   
I decided beforehand I wouldn't mention the earlier text as I wanted to give her a chance to bring it up herself - she doesn't. Unsuprisingly, no shenanigans either. She's tired so I let it go.  
Anyway, I'm chewing on this all day and realise I can't wait any longer so I text and say that I think she should tell me what was in the email. She says it was deleted when she sobered up. I say I think she should tell me what was in it, she also refuses. I say then I'll continue to think the worst, she says it was a topless photo. I ask if she's deleted it, she says she has. 
  
It does make some sense about it being a photo, except:
* she has sent me a photo before  
* but through MMS, not email
* she could have been straightup about it being a photo, and not an 'email' right from the start  

And that's where it stands...
TL;DR:
