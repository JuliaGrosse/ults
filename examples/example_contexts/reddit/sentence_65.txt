TITLE: I'm picking high school classes for next year, how important is a 3rd year of a foreign language for the college I want to go to?
POST: Hello reddit. I'm in need of your help. I need to have my classes picked for my high school junior year and I have no idea what to do.

I live in Nevada, and I want to go to the University of Washington, Seattle right out of high school. Next year I will be in my junior year of high school, so I'm picking classes. Here's my problem:

I'm taking the hardest classes available in my school. The problem is, I suck at my foreign language class. I already have 2 years of French. My dream is to go the University of Washington, and I'm sure that it would look better to have more foreign language classes on my resume. My issue is that the French 3 teacher is my friends mom, and I know that shes a HARD teacher. I am most likely going to fail if I take a third year of French.

I need to know how important it is for me to take a third year of French. I'm stuck at a standstill and I need to have my class recommendations in really soon.
TL;DR:
