TITLE: Me (22F) with my boyfriend (22M) - broke up, getting back together, need advice
POST: Boyfriend and I dated for about 7 years and he broke up with me two months ago. He said he needed to find himself outside of our relationship and see what's out there for him.

The last two months have been awful for me and I finally decided that I need to move on whether I want to or not, then he asked to meet/talk and said he wants to try being in a relationship with me again.

I want to be with him, but I'm afraid that getting back together will be awkward or weird. We spent the past two months with very limited contact, so I'm not sure how we can be normal again? How do I work this out? How do I go back into the relationship?
TL;DR:
