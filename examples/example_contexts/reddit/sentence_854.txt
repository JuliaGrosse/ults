TITLE: Me [22 M] with girl I've been casually dating [23 F], is it ever realistic to fight for someone's affection?
POST: So, I've been seeing such a cool girl this past month. We've had sex twice and have seen each other a few times a week. She's pretty introverted, works for a really popular venue and is sought after by so many guys.

The thing is, we seem to have so much fun when we're around one another but I continually am getting this vibe that I'm hanging from a thread and that she doesn't like me the way I like her. I texted her two days ago to hang out, she doesn't respond. In frustration I texted her today to ask her how she feels about me because I don't want to keep having feelings for someone who doesn't value me.

I actually told her I liked her about a week ago and she said she "liked hanging out with me", she also told me she may be moving in 8 months and she doesn't know if she wants to get attached. I thought that was her way of letting me down nicely but then we had sex the next day.

Anyway, after I texted her tonight, she asked if I'd like to meet up tomorrow evening. I suggested a cocktail place since she'd be free later at night. Idk what to think about it but I feel a lot of good things for her. Is she most likely gonna let me go tomorrow? Is there any point in trying to convince her that moving away in 8 months isn't a big deal and to try to convince her to like me? I'm not one to pine for affection but is it ever worth fighting for with someone who is on the fence?
TL;DR:
