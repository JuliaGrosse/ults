TITLE: How do I handle this?
POST: I (23m) and my ex-gf (20f) of almost 2 years broke up about a month ago. She had a really hard time with it at the time but has slowly been recovering. I miss her and I feel like we might be able to fix the issues we were facing.

Last night I was having a really hard time imagining what I would do without her and I texted her for the first time since the breakup and asked her to meet up this weekend to talk to which she agreed. 

So now I'm torn because on one hand I really want her back, I still love her. On the other hand, I'm afraid that maybe it still won't work and I'd end up putting her through the pain of the breakup again, which makes me sick thinking about. 

Does anyone have any similar experience or advice to help me out? I'm really lost.
TL;DR:
