TITLE: Is it going to get better?
POST: I've been pretty slack in terms of reading novels for say the past 10 years (except for Harry Potter), but decided over the last few months to get over myself and get back into reading.

I've got a list of good books to read (no idea where from) and decided to just buy book titles based on the title alone.

I read 1984 (pretty awesome) and then read The Wind Up Bird Chronicle (I finished both of them!).

I enjoyed both of them, my only problem being that I am struggling to read them and maintain interest for prolong periods of time. I will read 2 pages and get exhausted. Or read 3-4 pages and realise I haven't taken anything in.

Is this something that is going to improve? At the moment it feels like reading is a chore as opposed to a leisure activity.

The next book on my list is Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep.
TL;DR:
