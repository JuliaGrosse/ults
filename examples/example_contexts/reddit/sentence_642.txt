TITLE: Me [17F] with my BF [17 M] of 2.5 years, wants us to move in together after we graduate highschool.
POST: This is my first post, I am so confused need help.

I have been dating my boyfriend for two years (three in december). Since about a year into our relationship, he began to talk about moving in together. Me, being very much in love with him, wholeheartedly agreed on this plan. We talked about how great it would be, and he has even talked to his parents about it and they are all for helping us pay for an apartment.

Now that graduation is getting closer and I am beginning to send in college applications, I am realizing that I am not ready to be living with a SO at 18. 

But I am so in love with this man. I have dreams about making a house with him, getting married and having children with him. He has met my family and they love him. I can completely see him as a life-time partner.

I know I am 17, and young and stupid, but I am stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Please don't criticize me for my age, I really need help.
TL;DR:
