TITLE: Cant register car, outstanding parking tickets
POST: Im in ohio

Basically i have 1000 dollars in parking tickets while i was in the hospital and missed the court date to contest them and now they say i cant do anything about it now they are in collections. I dont have the money to pay them off.

My car died and i need a new one, but the dmv wont let me register a new car until i pay off the tickets.

I have another car. Just not registered.

I was wondering if my dad could put the car in his name and then i get some kind of non owners insurance to drive it.

However, i thought when you register a car in your name at the dmv you had to also provide proof of insurance in your name as well.
My dads insurance wont allow other people to drive his cars under his plan for some reason.

So i was wondering how i could drive the car with my non owners insurance with the car registered with his insurance, or is there someway for him to register the car without hia insurance since he will not be driving it.
TL;DR:
