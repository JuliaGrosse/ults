TITLE: Me [19F] with my boyfriend [19 M] of 6 months decided to take a break
POST: Today my boyfriend and I decided we should go on a break/break up. We have been having a rough time for the past 2 weeks, as both of us have been stressed about school, and the problems with our relationship have been adding to our stress. 

The problems we've been having are mostly due to me and my own insecurity in the relationship. In the past, I've been cheated on (my boyfriend with my best friend) and it has given me anxiety, however unfounded, that this will happen again in the future. 

My boyfriend keeps a lot of female friends/study buddies, and I understand this completely but for some reason it still bothers me. He also has developed a close relationship with my (female) roommate, who is one of my best friends. This really bothers me, it reminds me too closely of the terrible experience I've had with my cheating ex. 

The thing is I know that both my boyfriend and my friend are completely trustworthy, but still when they're alone together I get mild panic attacks (nausea, heart palpitations). My boyfriend knows that this is the effect it has on me. I know it's unreasonable of me to ask him to cut off this relationship with my roommate,  and with this putting such a strain on our relationship we decided to take a break.

But even now I know that I still want to be with him, but I don't know how to curb my anxiety/jealousy. I'm too embarrassed about it to talk to my roommate. Please help.
