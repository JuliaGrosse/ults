TITLE: TIFU by trying to flirt with a customer at work
POST: I'm a cashier at BJs, but I'm not going to say where to protect my anonymity.

So this really cute girl and her mom got on line. I was praying to god that I'd get to ring her up, and not the person behind me. I figured if it was meant to be then she'd end up at my register. Turns out I got lucky and I noticed she was next on my register. She was wearing a shirt with a bar code on it that read "Check Me Out" above it. Immediately an idea on how to flirt with her sparked into my head. So after her mom handed me their membership card, I tried scanning her shirt. When it wouldn't scan (for obvious reasons) I said, half jokingly "Oh no, you're not scanning properly. I'll have to get the item's number." She giggled and smiled at me. But her mother looked at me and said "You're disgusting!". Then she took their cart, grabbed her by the arm and went to another line. Later on a supervisor came up to me and told me they got a complaint that a customer was "uncomfortable with the way I was talking to their daughter."
TL;DR:
