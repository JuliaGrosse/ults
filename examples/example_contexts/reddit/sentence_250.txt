TITLE: My son has been a little terror lately!
POST: My 2 1/2 yr old son and I recently moved far away from all of our friends and family and because of this he's been really acting out. He's been throwing crazy fits for no reason, throwing hard, heavy toys at me, basically doing everything that I tell him not to. I understand that he's in the "terrible two's", but it's gotten so much worse since we moved and he isn't responding to the punishments that used to work. Between all of the stress that comes with moving and him acting out like he does, I've been getting migraines every other day. If someone could help a mother out, I would kiss the ground you walk on.
TL;DR:
