TITLE: Girlfriend (f22) spending more time with excoworker than me (m25)
POST: I (m25) have been with my girlfriend (f22) for 2 years. Lately, I've just been noticing for the past 2 months that she's been going out with a male excoworker. He's been picking her up from work when she told me not to pick her up. I've kind of taken the back seat. We've been having a few arguments lately so I've kind of stayed away from being confrontional. He's been calling and texting her while we are together to "hangout". But tonight I've learned that he is taking her to a mutal friends party rather than taking me. Her excuse was "She invited me and not you". I'm just really starting to get an uneasy feeling about all this.
