TITLE: [21M] could use some advice on a girl (20f)
POST: Not sure if this goes here 

Kinda long so please bare with me 

I have been single for awhile now I'd say roughly 3-4 years 

In high school I though I found "the one" we had been together all thought highs school, unfortunately life happened and she had passed from leukemia 

Needless to say it messed me up I now get anxiety and shy when are females any girl I feel Is worth a chance I get discourage and back down 

While I think I may have found someone who is worth my time and I may have a chance with, I have talked to her before a few years back but I doubt she'd remember me, she constantly post stuff about how she always wants to be in a relationship and stuff couple related 

I just don't know how to go about talking to her, or saying the first words in general I get so nervous I just stammering 

Could really use help reddit 

Thank you for listening
TL;DR:
