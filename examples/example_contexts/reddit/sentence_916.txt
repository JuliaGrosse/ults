TITLE: need advice on how to help my brother deal with the emotional toll of being burglarized by a "friend"
POST: so this easter, my mother, brother, brothers gf and i visited family in canada.  it was an amazing vacation of course, everyone wants a break from their "real" life. anyway, we returned home 5 days later to find my brothers apartment had been broken into, turned inside out, and emptied. 55" LG smart tv, 32" samsung tv, ps3, wii, 2 computers, keurig, tools, jewelry(given by family members who are no longer alive). THEY TOOK EVERYTHING. his place looked like a before scene of a security system commercial. they even took his car. this great vacation chopped down by the grime of our society. to top it all off, he suspects that his first friend he met when he moved to CT was the one who either orchestrated it, or carried out the act, which you can tell my bro doesnt truely want to admit to himself. he drove this "friends"  pregnant girlfriend around, dropped laundry, lent money, things friends do for friends. and this guy turns around and pulls some horrid act like this. i know my brother feels helpless and victimized because i feel that way and it wasnt even me that this happened to. he is already a person who silently suffers with mild depression because of his weight which leads him to already shy away from life. i dont want him to burrow deeper.  how can i help him pick up and carry on? or get him to help himself?* I SHOULD ADD THIS "FRIEND" HAS PRIOR GUN CHARGES.
TL;DR:
