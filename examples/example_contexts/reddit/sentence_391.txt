TITLE: My 36-yr-old brother had a heart attack today.
POST: My brother is in the hospital.  Last night, he had some pain in his arms and in his back.  He said it felt like a muscle ache.  He couldn't sleep all night, and in the morning went to the Walgreens walk-in clinic.  They told  him he might be having a heart attack and to get to the ER.  Well, they were right.  He drove himself to the hospital, where they determined one of the main arteries in his heart had 100% blockage.  They brought him into the cath lab, removed the clot, and put in a stent.  With the stent in place, the blood flow is back and there is no more blockage.

They say he will be in the hospital for a few days.  There is some concern about how long the heart tissue went without blood flow, and there could be some serious tissue damage.  But the doctor was hopeful that it won't have a serious impact on his quality of life.  The good news is that as far as they can tell, all the other arteries are totally clean and there were no other blockages (not even partial blockages).  So this may have just been a clot that formed somewhere that broke off and traveled to the heart.  I'm not sure if we'll ever get definitive answers.

This has certainly been eye-opening -- a 36-year-old non-smoker, non-drinker, non-druggie having a heart attack.  I never expected to get a call like the one I got today.  It's been a bit of a surreal day, but I believe he will be OK and my family will be OK. 

I wanted to post this to make people aware that not all heart attacks are grabbers, where you feel chest pains and the "typical" pain in your left arm.  If he had known this was a heart attack when the symptoms first started, the damage may have been minimized.  Thanks for listening, reddit.
