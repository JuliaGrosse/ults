SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I(19M) like my friend (22F) who is thinking of breaking up with her boyfriend.
POST: Btw, Sorry for using a throw away, the girl in question knows my main account.

Hi, I (19M) am quite attracted to my best friend (22F), but before now there hasn't ever been any time that i could really do anything about it and not be an asshole (because she has had a boyfriend).
Backstory: 2 years ago, she was my boss when we used to work together. We didnt really become out of work friends until after i quit that job.
Then last spring, we really hit it off and became extremely close. We would hangout, go to clubs, ect (at this time she had a fairly new boyfriend)
One night after we went to a club, on her way home at 3:30 AM she got into a bad car accident and was rushed to the hospital. I was the only person she called from the ambulance. So i run to the hospital and stay the next 2 days with her until she was discharged. During this time, her boyfriend came for about 2 hours, and her grandmother for about 4 hours. After she was discharged, she moved in with her boyfriend of ~2 weeks because she had no car to go to / from work.
About 2 months pass and she tells me she plans on breaking up with her boyfriend when he leaves for college out of state (3 hour drive away) because she is looking for a long term relationship, and she cant do that with someone she cant hold a conversation with. But alas, she remains with him.
I get a job with her again, he moves back here, she moves out. Then about a week ago she was telling me how she really wants to break up with him, but one of the things holding her back is that he wouldn't take it well... but she has a LOT of things that she hates about him.
Overall, my end goal is to end up dating her and i'm looking for advice on how to move forward.
TL;DR:
