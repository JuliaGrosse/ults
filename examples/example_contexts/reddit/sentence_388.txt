SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [24M] broke up with her [29f] of 1.5 years. That was a month ago. And I'm miserable
POST: I broke up with her due to ongoing trust issues which culminated in a lie she held up for the duration of our relationship over a past fling. The past is the past, but she kept him as a friend. I was upset she lied to me for so long and reluctantly ended our relationship. We were both devastated. 

--

She has been begging for me back, and I really want to take her back. We haven't spoken in about a week, after about a month of noncommittal contact from her really trying to get us back together. 

--

I really am upset about it. I loved her. It wasn't always easy, but there were definitely way more good times than bad. I want to forgive her. I want to try again. The majority of my close friends/family say I should take more time and find someone new. Some friends think I should hook up real soon to help get over her.  

--

Thing is I don't want to get over her. I know what we had was mutually loved. I know she is remorseful and sincere in her apology. 

I guess I'm curious if anyone has had a similar experience. If anyone has forgiven and succeeded. Forgiven and failed. Forgiven and regretted. My gut tells me to stay and forgive because it can truly be good. But I'm a romantic.... And I'm worried I'm being naive.
TL;DR:
