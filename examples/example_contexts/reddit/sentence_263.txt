TITLE: Reddit, what do you think of children on leashes?
POST: I just saw a group of about 5 small children walking with two adults, and they all were holding onto a blue leash thing. I took notice of this, and I wonder if anyone else looks at such a sight with just as much curiosity. I didn't know whether or not to judge the adults, but in the end, I felt it was probably safer for the children, but I'm not really sure why it is safer. I suppose it prevents one of them from running off, leaving the adults in a sticky situation - should I leave these other children behind and race after that child so he/she does not get hurt? Also imagine if 2 or more of the children started running in different directions. How does an adult manage that? 

Reddit, do you think children should be put on leashes? What do you think society thinks of it? I feel society feels like it is abnormal to see such a sight, maybe even cruel, but in the end, I personally think it is best for the children and the adults. Children are not predictable and can do something scary like run off into the middle of the street, and when you are with other children you cannot abandon them to go chase down that other child.

I think children leashes have a bad reputation, and I'm not sure if I'd ever use one,but if they were more acceptable, it would make me feel a lot more comfortable knowing that if I had more than one child with me and I was responsible for their care, that none of them would be running off leaving me in a terrible, split second decision making situation that could end up badly.
TL;DR:
