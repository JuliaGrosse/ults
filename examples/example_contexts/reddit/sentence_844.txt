TITLE: Running after injury
POST: 5 years ago a buddy of mine got in a fight and I stepped in. There where 5 of them and two of us and after a while one of the other guys pulled out a street sign and used is to break my right leg. My shinbone and the one behind that(don't know the English name) where shattered. 
After two surgeries and 2 years (and some more surgeries) of trying to get back on my feet I was able to function normally again.
In those two years I finished my school and my career took flight. I used to do a lot op sports and was really fit. Now, three years later, I am trying to get fit again. I took on crossfit and after a lot of shameful sessions where girls where faster and stronger than I am (and I am a 2 meter tall 115kg weighing guy) I can say I am starting to get fit again. 
The only thing I can't seem to get down is the running part. The 400 till 800 meters running there is in crossfit I can't seem to do without completely draining myself. My muscles sour almost immediately and after a couple of hundred meters I have to pause. The muscles that fail are the ones in the foot/leg that you use when launching yourself in the air with your hind leg and landing on your heel with the front leg (difficult to explain in english) after a while I launch with a flat foot and land on a flat foot. The muscles are strong and developed, they just don't seem to be able to keep going for a longer time.
Do any of you have any tips or exercises i can do to improve? 
What I have been doing; calf raises and trying to lose weight (with my weight all training is strength training not conditioning :s)
TL;DR:
