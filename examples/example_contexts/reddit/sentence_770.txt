SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [23,F] slept with a friend [27,M] that I had been seeing for months, but then he left me the next morning.
POST: Disclaimer: This is more to get things off my chest than ask for advice.

I had made friends with a guy who I thought was nice and over the course of our 5 month friendship we talked about dating at some point and really seemed to have fun and do stuff together.

This past Friday night we went and did some Halloween mazes, and I spent the night at his house. This was our first time having sex, being that he said he wants a relationship with me. The next morning around 8ish, he woke me up to tell me that his uncle wanted to spend time with him. So I was okay with that. He said that I could come back later that day and we could hang. Fast forward to later, and he tells me not to come over cause his dad came home from his weekend trip and was sick.

Come Sunday, and there are no texts and calls at all. I sent him texts with no replies no calls back. I go to that bathroom the next night and there's a condom when I wipe! Ivrealize his condom got stuck in me at some point, and he didn't even bother to tell me. I became worried, but I'm on the pill and my period should be this Friday and I've been feeling the usual period symptoms (unless my brain is playing a trick on me and I'm not menstrating come Friday).

Then today I decide to call to see if I can get through with this condom business. He answers the phone with, "Who's this?" I quickly lose my nerve and hang up. Then I get a text from his number telling me it's his girlfriend and I should leave him alone he doesn't want me and I quote, my "stanky, nasty pussy" anymore.

Now, I currently feel hurt and very dumb. Granted it was only 5 months, and I should be okay come next week, for the moment this feels like he ripped my heart out with his lies, and I can't help but wonder, was anything he told me the truth. I thought I'd feel better typing out my feelings.
TL;DR:
