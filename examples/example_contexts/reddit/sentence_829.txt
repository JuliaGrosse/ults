SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [M 21] agreed and signed to move to my gf's [F 19] college town, and now that the move in date is near, I am second guessing everything.
POST: Backstory: I have been dating my gf for over 3 years now, the last 2 have been long distance (just 3 hours).

About 3 months ago I left my IT helpdesk job and decided I needed to go back to school for a BA in programming. Since that job was one of the major things keeping me in my town, my gf proposed me moving to her town. Since I am doing online classes, I would be able to move and live with two of her male friends that I have become good friends with.

It sounded like a great idea, new town, new friends, and only being a short walk away from her apartment. But then I started really thinking about what this all meant. 

This means that I am committing to this relationship much more then I ever have, not to say that Im half-assing the relationship now. I guess I'm really scared of this big of a commitment. Now I'm second guessing everything, especially my lack of experience outside of this relationship (we have both only ever had sex with each other). 

On one hand I really want to experience the thrill of a new person, but I know everyone goes through that phase and I know the real goal for me is a life long partner. 

I feel like its too late for a "break" and I already tried that idea to little avail. I love her so much and I feel like we are really great for each other. I do not want to risk our 3 year relationship for no reason. But what if we are just habitually together? I just want to get this nagging feeling out of my head. 

Oh and the lease starts at my new place in her town on august fifteenth, so I have to have it figured out by then.

please help
