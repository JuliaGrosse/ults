TITLE: I [23 M] asked a girl I met at work [22 F], I met her about a month go, out to get a drink and she agreed but stopped responding?
POST: I asked out this girl I met at work about a month ago to go to drinks with me and she smiled and said yes. I told her I would get back to her with a time. I didn't outright set a time though, I just kinda talked about random stuff with her the first time we messaged.

 Each message she sent me was pretty long and full of smiley faces. I asked her If she was available on Wednesday and she said maybe but she needed to get her new schedule from her new job. 

She got back to me to tell me that she couldn't Wednesday and she would get back to me with a better time. its been like four days now and haven't heard from her. should I message her again and what should I say?
TL;DR:
