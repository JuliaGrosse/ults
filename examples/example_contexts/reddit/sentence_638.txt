TITLE: TIFU by swearing at a customer over the phone.
POST: Background information: I work in a call centre. A debt recovery company. The department I work in is television licensing. Yes. Our country, UK, has to pay Â£145.50 annually to watch TV. People who have missed their payments gets their account passed over to us and we hunt them down for what they owe. 

So I received an inbound call (Call coming in just in case) and our system doesn't tell is who's exactly ringing is so we open the call like this: "Hello you're through to 'insert name' at 'insert company.' Can I please take your file reference number please?' The file reference is found on s letter we sent them. But not this one. 
This call had some guy go ape shit crazy. As soon as I had finished talking he shouted "I WANT YOUR COMPANY TO STOP FUCKING CALLING ME. I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR MY LICENSE. NOW PISS OFF"
Obviously it's within my company policy to not give shit to the customer so I politely said "Sorry to hear about that. Could I just take your number down so I could bring your account on my screen?" And then for two minutes he kept saying to remove his number from our company, he doesn't want to pay, were harassing him etc. and every time I'm advising him that I can't bring up his account unless he tells me his number. Then he shouts at me "JUST REMOVE MY FUCKING NUMBER FROM YOUR COMPANY YOU FUCKING PAKISTANI C**T."
This is where I lost my shit and shouted at him down the phone "I can't remove your number from our system unless you give me your fucking number for fuck sakes. How many times do I have to fucking tell you!?"
This was within ear shot of 5 people which included my team manager who all looked at me in shock and my manager ended up pulling me aside after I hung up and I had a verbal warning. The only reason why I didn't get fired was because I'm fairly new so it's my first experience.
TL;DR:
