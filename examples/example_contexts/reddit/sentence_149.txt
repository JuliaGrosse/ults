POST: Okay, so here's my story: 9 years ago my boyfriend died. He had been out of contact with his family during most of the time we were together, and they lived across the country so I had no opportunity to really get to know them at all. When he died, I flew across the country to go to the funeral and I was able to meet his mother, father, and sister. I was all kinds of messed up at the time and I have since lost everything that I ever had regarding the whereabouts of his family. I have periodically searched the internet to see if I can find them, and recently his little sister opened a FB account. I really want to get in touch but I don't know what to say, and I don't want to upset the family. I should mention that his family was very gracious with me and they were thankful of my relationship with him, so I know that they don't hate me. What do I do? Do I send this girl a message? What should it say? Thank you for any insights.
TL;DR:
