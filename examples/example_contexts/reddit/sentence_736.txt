TITLE: I[19 M] am going to counseling to get help with my insecurities over my Girlfriend's [18F] past
POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. We met over the summer before university started, and I fell head over heels. We started texting, but I did't think she was interested, and she didn't think I was either. We started talking again after uni started, and we fell in love. 

I lost my virginity to her. Later in the fall semester she told me about her sexual past, which was mainly over the summer when we met. She told me how ashamed of it she was because she let multiple guys use her to get attention because she was going through depression, and she never enjoyed it. She tells me I'm the best she's ever had, and she never knew sex could be as loving as what we have. 

For the record, I was raised conservative(gigantic liberal now), so I still have some conceptions about promiscuous women from how I was raised, but she challenges everything I ever thought about women like that. However, I still get very insecure over her past. I envision the other guys still having sex with her. I know it's not rational, and I have realized that I would be this way with any other girl I date unless she's a virgin, which I don't particularly care for. It makes me worry about the future of the relationship, so I decided I wanted to get counseling.
TL;DR:
