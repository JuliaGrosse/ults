SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: So I went to a party Wednesday. I was the only straight, single guy there and the only straight, single girl there turned me down. Reddit, when have you too had the sweet spot of odds and still got nowhere?
POST: I'll elaborate slightly on my story. I'm at university (college for US users) and live next door to students at a rival university.

It's Halloween evening and my 'wonderful' housemates pull the same shit they always do. Go out without me. 

I pop into my kitchen and see next door having an awesome party.

Socially awesome penguin goes round next door, ringing doorbell and knocking door. Note that we haven't had much to do with these guys yet. Said hi once or twice, but not much else. Socially awkward penguin quickly realises no one will answer the door as they assume it's trick or treaters.

Nip back round my house and in the back garden of next door is a guy from next door out smoking. A quick conversation with a housemate that lives there later and I'm making my way back round with a few beers.

Sit down and quickly realise this is mostly members of said rival universities LGBT society. Fine. A parties a party. Have a laugh, drink a bit. Trawl back home at stupid-o-clock.

I find one of the girls there is the only straight girl there (no bi girls, either). 

Everyone is playing drinking games / chatting etc, I get roped in to a twisted version of truth or dare. 

I get a dare of kiss the person to my right. Which was said girl. So I do. She gets the "what is your magic number" later on. Turns out she "lost count at about 40". (magic number = how many people have you slept with).

Skipping on to later on in the eve, I'm dancing the night away with everyone and enjoying myself, she gets back in from the garden and gives me the "like you've got a chance look".

Everyone else leaves much later on. I'm the last to leave the party, skulking home again to my bed alone.
TL;DR:
