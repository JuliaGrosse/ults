TITLE: Me [22 M] with my new flirt [22F] of a month, She wants a lot of sex, I do too, but not this much
POST: Okay so... I haven't been in a real relationship before (nothing more than 8-9 months) and the sex has always faded down to once or twice a week. I met this AWESOME and AMAZING girl by coincidence, and I am really starting to fall for her. We took things slow, and didn't start sexual intercourse untill 3 weeks or so passed.

Now, She wants it all the time. Which is awesome. Except she wants it too much, and I am not comfortable declining. Today we had sex 7 times, in which I 'finished' in the first 5, which meant I could barely breathe the 6th and 7th time. I asked her how much she usually has, and told her I was used to once or twice a week, but could do more. She literally gasped at this, and told me she wanted atleast once everytime we saw eachother - atleast when its appropriate. 

I don't mind this, but I've never really turned down sex before, and I need to know how to do it without hurting her feelings or make her feel inadequate. I know it's probably every guys dream, and I must admit I am quite thrilled she wants more than me - I just don't know if I can keep up.
TL;DR:
