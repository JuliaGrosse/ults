TITLE: Failing a college class resulting in a string of events
POST: I'm a senior in college majoring in Biology and also an ROTC cadet. I failed my required chemistry class, which was a little unexpected for me. The thing is, I've been looking to commission as an officer my entire college career. As such, I don't have any internship experiences or don't even have a resume. My whole college career, I've been looking to commission as an officer. 

The thing is, I am not the best cadet, but I've managed to get through 4 years of ROTC without getting kicked out. But because I've failed that chem class, I might not be able to make it as an officer. I already have 2 strikes for ROTC, and this would be my third strike, resulting in possible disenrollment from the program. I've been trying to get a hold of my professor, just to at least talk to her about it, but she will not answer my emails at all. She told me that she would pass me if I showed improvement in my exams, but our final was exceptionally hard. Average was 50/150 points. And I got around a 30. My other two exams before had shown improvement. My commander said that if I can somehow get that failing grade to change to a C- (which is the minimum passing grade) then it would change everything. I keep trying to contact my professor but she won't respond to anything. I don't know what I should do now.
TL;DR:
