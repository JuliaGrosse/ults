TITLE: Would porn help me?
POST: So my girlfriend and I have been together a long time. (3 years) I'm 18 and she is 18. her stance on pornography was that it is degrading to women, and I have respected her views by not watching porn. 

We both have missed out on the sexual part of our relationship recently because it seems that when we do have the chance to be alone, I will often try to move things too quickly or to try and push her more than she is in the mood for. We have talked about this, and we both really want to get back in the swing of things so to speak. She suggested that if i thought it would help then maybe I should watch porn.

I'm not sure if it would help me, I obviously know that I dont want to push her in any way, but we dont have time alone together very often and maybe that because alone time is rare that I want to try and do more than what she is willing to? I said I dont know when she asked (last night) but I want to bring it back up if I think it will be a good idea.
TL;DR:
