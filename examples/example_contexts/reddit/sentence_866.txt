TITLE: I found out that my girlfriend has been sending pics of herself in the nude to my best friend. What should I do??
POST: My friend was over today and we were just chilling out like usual. I noticed a picture of someone familiar on his phone but no matter how many times I inquired as to who it was he still wouldn't tell me. He got up to use the restroom and, as he did, his phone fell from his pocket without him noticing. Being the curious person I am I picked up the phone to see who it was and, to my horror, it was a nude picture of my girlfriend. He got out of the restroom and I promptly yelled at him to get the fuck out of my house. He ran out and seemed pretty confused. I confronted my GF about it. She keeps denying that she sent it. I saw the picture with my own eyes. I even checked and made sure it was from her number! I know worse things have happened but I'm pretty upset about this and I was wondering if anyone might have advice.
TL;DR:
