SUBREDDIT: r/books
TITLE: I was just disappointed by the two later books in "The Giver" trilogy. What books in a series do you wish you never read?
POST: After reading "The Giver" in 6th grade, it's always stuck with me. Once or twice a year I'll give this book a read. The ending has always struck me as powerful, because you're left with a kid who's run off and at this point has no one, dying in the snow. In his dying moments he hears music in front of him, and maybe behind him, as a sign of his ultimate sacrifice in order to bring color to the world. I've always seen it as a strong, poetic ending and I think it's shaped much of my philosophy in life. For reference sake I'm now 27.

Spoiler alert. Then I had to go and read books two and three and find out that the kid from The Giver's not dead at all. He went and became leader of another dystopian future-town (that I guess has been inundated with the horrors of capitalism through the Trade Mart?)
TL;DR:
