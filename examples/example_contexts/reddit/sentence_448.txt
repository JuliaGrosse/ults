SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [20 M] have been feeling guilty about my situation with my girlfriend [19 F] of one and a half years and can't really figure out what to do.
POST: I am in my 3rd year of university, and this current year, because I didn't do so well in my courses last year, I have been put on academic probation for the duration of the year.

When I told my girlfriend she was very supportive of what I told her and said that she loved me and that this didn't change how she felt about me.

Now this is the kind of reaction I was hoping for, because I wanted some support, when I told my parents, there was just a lot of yelling and making me feel guilty about all of it, which I do and I understand that I fucked up, I'm trying to make amends this year by taking certain courses to be accepted back into my program.

And so when I told my girlfriend and she was very okay with everything it was a change up to what I was used to. And she'll tell me I'm smart and that she's proud of me for trying to get back on track but I still feel extremely guilty.

Cause the things that are worrying me is that what if I can't get back on track and then when I'm a university drop out, she'll leave me. Or what if because of this I go nowhere in life and she chooses to stay with me and I drag her down.

She seems okay with my situation and I have yet to ask her about the "what if" of me not finishing my program. I've just grown up with a family that looked down on those that didn't succeed and when she did the complete opposite I was surprised and kind of like I wanted her to be upset with me.

So all I want is some kind of advice as to whether I should talk to her about it, or if I should leave it and just put more focus on school hoping that she actually is okay with it all.
TL;DR:
