SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [23 M] with my gf [21 F] 3 weeks, Online dating trust issues.
POST: I met my current gf of about 3 weeks on an online dating website. About 2 days later we meet up at my place, hook up, have a good time etc. The day after we decide to make it a mutual relationship with each other as exclusive.

I am concerned however about some possible red flags that are coming up often and repeatedly. She always wants me to express my feelings about her and I always say that I like her and I want her to be my gf. However, she always brings up being afraid of being cheated on, left for some other girl and not wanting to waste her time.

Now I wouldnt be so concerned about this usually as we are a new couple and all and trust isn't fully formed as that takes a bit of time. However, when we were together at her place I reached for my vaporizer and she was on her phone. she immediately shields her phone from me seeing it. I thought it was really odd and she seemed upset afterwards. I kept asking her whats wrong and if shes ok a few times and she would not tell me why she was acting that way. I left it alone and brought it up the next day. She said she was talking to a guy she had "a long story with" and she eventually told me he kept ditching her or whatever and she had given him money a few times to come see her. I was like ok, tried to explain that he probably doesn't care about her in that way and moved on.

She also continuously browses dating websites still even when I am around her. And has on more than a few occasions talked about her latest ex in great detail and on one occasion called me by his name accidentally.

Now is this some sort of insecurity/self esteem issues or are these truly red flags? or am i just being some sort of insecure/jealous asshole?
TL;DR:
