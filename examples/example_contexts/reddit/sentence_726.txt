TITLE: Boyfriend (27 M) cheated on me (29 F) now we are engaged. Any success stories of relationships with rough starts?
POST: I am deeply in love with my boyfriend and he has had many problematic behaviors in the past. He has cheated on me, lied compulsively and struggled with his drinking. All of this in the first five months of our relationship. He has done a lot to improve himself: going to AA, trying to go without drinking, communicating/being transparent and going to a therapist. He has always had a huge amount of willingness/commitment to staying in our relationship. I have been struggling with pretty serious emotional dysregulation and have tried to leave the relationship so many times. I was previously diagnosed with BPD (have gone through recovery in DBT) but it makes all of this even harder that I am so sensitive emotionally... I am suppose to be happy I am engaged and this is one of my dreams but I feel so sad and doubtful from all the conflict we have been through. I am afraid he is getting tired of my processing all of this stuff and starting to withdrawal a bit too. Feel so uncertain. I would like to move forward and be healthy with him but I am not sure...

Do other people have experiences with rocky starts to a relationship that ended up working out? How did you get through it together? Any tips? Thank you!!
