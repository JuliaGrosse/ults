TITLE: Boyfriend [M/21] struggles with alcoholism, how can I [F/22] help him?
POST: I made an account just to post here. I am in a terrible spot in my relationship and though the wise people of reddit could help. 
I [22/F] have been with my boyfriend [21/M] for two years. I can honestly say he is the love of my life. I want to marry him and have a family someday when we're done with college. 
However, about 6 months in the relationship, he admitted to me about past occurrences with the law. He has a history of drug and alcohol abuse but saw our relationship as a new chance. I took this to heart and have done nothing but encourage him, like calling him just to tell him he's important or not drinking around him.
 He got arrested for drunk driving one night on his way to get me from class. I stayed with him the whole year he was on house arrest (although I spend 1/2 that on an out of state internship). Now he is on probation and thinks maybe one or two drinks is okay, even though it goes explicitly against the rules.
 I've done almost everything in my power besides breaking up with him to Give some kind of "wake up call" but he continues with immature behavior. What should I do to help an alcoholic who I love dearly?
TL;DR:
