TITLE: Am I [20 M] being an asshole? [20 F] has a boyfriend
POST: I met this girl at a party and we started talking and flirting. At the end she gave me her number, we've been texting since Sunday morning. We got pretty close and kept flirting, and she told me she liked me.

Well, she asks me what I'm doing for Valentine's day, I say that I unfortunately have to work. She replies with "aw that sucks. I'm spending the day with my boyfriend and dinner with my parents" My reaction in my mind is wait, back the fuck up, your boyfriend? 

She apologizes for not telling me but says that she didn't expect to fall for me. We both already like each other at this point, and she tells me she wished we had kissed at the party. I tell her that I don't want to be thaat guy, I've been cheated on before and it sucks. I also say if we keep talking, on Saturday valentines day I don't want to say okay have a fun day hanging with/fucking your boyfriend I'll be here to flirt when you get home! That's wrong in my eyes. She said she thinks of me when she's with her boyfriend. Just hanging out and doing sexual things

I have two conflicting emotions. I already like her a lot and it really sucks knowing that the person you like is with another guy. on the other hand though I don't want to be that guy I don't want to break up the relationship or have her cheat on him with me. I don't want to be with someone who is willing to cheat. 

Am I being an asshole by talking to her? Its not like she told me straight out that she has a boyfriend, we were already close by the time she told me
TL;DR:
