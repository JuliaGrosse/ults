TITLE: My friend has depression?
POST: I've been helping me friend through his depression, listening to him and how he feels and such. Recently we got into a fight after I did a small prank to him "think it will cheer him up" and surprise surprise, it didn't work. It pissed him off, now he won't talk to me. He thinks the world revolves around him and is constantly saying "My life sucks" and "Life isn't worth living". I do care for him, and absolutely love him to death as a friend, but I need a break from this. It's affecting me, I feel like crap when I'm around him, and it's depressing. He stopped texting me because of the prank, and is telling my best friend, who has enough problems, about stuff going on in his life. I'm pissed because they barley talk to each other and she texted me saying "I feel so bad for (depressed friend)" when she barely knows what's going on. I'm furious right now. I have to apologize to him on Monday, but I don't know what to say! I feel so guilty and I'm furious at the same time. How can I make it up to him??? Help me Reddit!!!!
