TITLE: Me [16M] with my Possible Crush/Friend [14F] of a few weeks is upset with someone, what should I say?
POST: Emily and myself were at a swim practice.  We were working out with the team, talking and laughing occasionally, when coach writes up a very difficult set on the board.  It starts out fine, but since Emily has shoulder problems, she gets out periodically to stretch.  

  Coach has a history of not really putting himself in Emily's shoes when it comes to understanding her limitations.  He talks to her at the end of practice about "not putting in enough effort" and "taking too many breaks."  This, obviously, was very upsetting to her.  I am at a distance getting ready to leave, while she walks to the door talking to her friend about what happened.

  *Here's the tough part,* on the way out I just WALKED BY while she talked to her friend without saying anything.  Didn't stop to listen or ask if she was ok.  Kicking myself for not stopping, but I don't even know what I would have said if I did.

  
  My question is, what do I say now!?  I have the option to text her now or tomorrow.  If I do, I can ask if she's ok, but she'll remember I totally ignored her before.  I just don't want to loose a friendship here, she's really an all around inspiring, kind, and great person I'd love to know better.
TL;DR:
