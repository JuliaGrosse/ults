TITLE: I (33F)just found out my fiancé (26M) has no one to invite to our wedding. Together 3years.
POST: Sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammar. I've been crying for the past hour... So here goes.. We're starting to plan our wedding and I find out that my fiancé won't have anyone to invite to the wedding.

I had my sister over to help me start planning our wedding.  Well when we got to the guest list, I'm list all my family and friends. The list was getting pretty long. So, my sister asked my fiancé for names, and he stated flatly that he didn't have any one to invite. I know that his mom left when he was you and his dad passed, but I figured there would be aunts and uncles.. But he says he hasn't seen or heard from any of them since he was a kid and wouldn't even know how to contact them. Plus, it'd be weird he says he doesn't know them at all..

I asked him about a few of his old friends he used to hang out with. And he said he didn't want to talk about it. When I finally pried the answer out of him, he said his friends didn't like me, and so they stopped invite him to hang out.. So they drifted a part and haven't talked in years. So yea there it is... He has no friends because he chose me...

sorry for if this is rambling. I'm so angry at myself I don't know  how I missed him not ever hanging out with anyone. I guess when he'd go off riding he went alone. 

He left an hour ago to go ride his motorcycle to clear his mind.. He seemed upset.. I hope he comes back... I'm here heart broken.
TL;DR:
