SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [m, 24] Found out my gf [f, 23] mainly watches porn where the woman is cheating on her husband/boyfriend--should I be worried?
POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year now. Lately she's been acting differently. In the beginning of our relationship, we were having a lot of sex, but in the past month or two it has decreased to about every other day. She's chalked it up to being extra busy with school and work, but it felt pretty abrupt to me. Now, I know I should not have done thisâ€”but I became worried that she was cheating on me, so I quickly went through her browser history. We both watch porn, sometimes even together. But what I found was a little shocking: the majority of the porn she watches consists of women cheating on their spouses, oftentimes with ex-boyfriends. Does this mean she is thinking about cheating on me? I didn't find any evidence that she is cheating on me, but what I found makes me feel like she wants to. Should I bring this up to her? Is this a big red flag, or am I overreacting?
TL;DR:
