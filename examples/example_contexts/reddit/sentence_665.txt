TITLE: Is my [23M] dating apathy normal?
POST: Hey I'm a 23M just living my life and trying to have fun. I got out of a difficult 1.5 year relationship about six months ago, but went NC after hooking up for a few months, four months ago.

Since then I've hooked up with a few women, and have briefly dated a bunch but I've ended all of them after a few weeks at most. 

Although I'm happy being single and really enjoying my space, and freedom to devote time to friendships and work, lately I have been yearning to have a partner. 

I met a cute girl the Friday night. Got her number and set up a date for tomorrow night (night has been reserved but I haven't confirmed plans yet). The thing is, now I'm totally apathetic about it. I barely know her and it just seems like energy and time. What is the point? I'm not that enthusiastic about this at all, but I feel like I need to put myself out there to meet people and move on with my life. 

Anyway don't know what to do. Part of me wants to go on the date and see what she is like, part of me just wants to cancel or make an excuse.

Anyone else feel like this? How do I get out of the apathy phase, or do I just go with it?
TL;DR:
