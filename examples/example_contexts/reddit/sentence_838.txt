SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [20 F] am starting to develop feelings for a friend [21], even though I have a boyfriend [21] of almost two years.
POST: I'm entering my second year of college, and this will mark the second year of being relatively long distance from my boyfriend, which I think complicates the issue. Last year, I went to a party with a friend, and was introduced to all his friends. I quickly became a part of their "group," and was informed early on by these friends that one of the guys liked me a lot. I made it clear to him that I had a boyfriend, and he's made no efforts to flirt or anything since then. In the meantime, we've become very good friends. We talk almost daily, and I love spending time with him. 

Recently, however, I've found myself being attracted to him, and I fantasize about being able to touch him, not even in a sexual way, but just to be close and cuddle, if you will. I need to be clear that I do not want to and will not ever cheat. But these feelings are growing stronger, and it's not as simple as cutting him out of my life, not just because we share many mutual friends, but also because I genuinely appreciate him as a friend. Sometimes I find myself thinking "well, if your current relationship fails, then you can give it a go with him and see what it's like." I don't know how to process these feelings, and it's unfair to everyone involved. Advice, please?
TL;DR:
