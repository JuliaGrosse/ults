TITLE: My coworker is a lesbian who is uncomfortable with her sexuality [23f] and our male coworkers [24-30ish] are giving her a hard time about it. How do I support her?
POST: One of my coworkers is an adorable sweet Asian girl who joined my team about 3 months ago. We all assumed she was straight. We found out last week (though she wasn't the one who brought it up) that she prefers women and she's in a relationship with a woman right now. 

Some male coworkers on my team who are in their mid-20s are being immature teenage boys about it. They're not mean-spirited at all -- they have the best intentions when tease her about it (and I know they only tease her because it's not a big deal), but I can tell it makes her uncomfortable. 

From what I've judged, she seems to be still uncomfortable with her sexuality. She has a hard time sticking up for herself, and she doesn't tell the guys to knock it off. She tries laughing it off, but I know she would like them to stop. 

I'm a 32 year old woman and we're the only women on the team (yay tech). I'm not a manager, and I don't have any direct authority over our male coworkers. I want to ask the guys to stop, but at the same time, I don't want to be the overbearing maternal coworker who takes everything too seriously, ESPECIALLY when she herself laughs along with them and hasn't asked them to stop.  What can I do to support her?
TL;DR:
