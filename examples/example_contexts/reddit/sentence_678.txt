TITLE: What is the most worst thing your friend has done to another person?
POST: For me, my friend ( Let's call him... Arthur)was actually asked to Prom by a girl he was friends with since Freshman year. She surprised him with flowers and he responded with "Yeah, sure." Afterwards, when his best friend (Let's call him...Samuel) asked Arthur why he was going (At this point, Samuel just finished venting to Athur that Prom was a waste of money and they could go do other stuff.) Wanting to hang out with his bud instead, he replies "I'm not really going with her lol." So basically, he pretends to say yes to a girl and not even inform her of his change in plans. She had to find out from word of mouth.
TL;DR:
