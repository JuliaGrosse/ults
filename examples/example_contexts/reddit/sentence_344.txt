TITLE: TIFU by ripping my pants at work NSFW
POST: This happened today before lunch. So i work at a construction company doing remodels and new structures. I was installing crown molding (which is like baseboard but for the ceiling) and i was standing on a 6ft ladder on the second to last step (yes i know im short) when suddenly my partner asks for help. 

So i jumped off the second to last step  from the 6ft ladder and then when i land i hear a rip/tear like noise from down under. I look down and yep my shorts ripped from under the zipper to my inner thigh on my right leg and feel a cool breeze. So i panicked and got some tape to cover my crotch thinking it would work but nope, the rip just started to expand and get wider. 

Luckily this happened right before lunch. So i jump into my car and drive to a fast food joint( went to the drive thru because i was to embarassed to go inside) contemplating on going to the store to buy a new pair of jeans or shorts but i was way too embarassed to show my crotch to the world so i didnt.  

I drive back to work, and to my surprise, i see 2 flashy/exotic cars on the driveway. And then i remebered that today the realtors and potiential clients were going to come and see the house that we were working on. With my ripped pants i decided to eat my lunch in my car. So i waited for them to leave to back inside when i heard one of the lady realtors say to her coworker "i forgot my earphones ill be right back" then i remembered that i left my earphones on the kitchen counter. I saw her leave with some earphones on her hand so i rush inside to the kitchen counter and yep she took my earphones.  Shouldve wore pants today.
TL;DR:
