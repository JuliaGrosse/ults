TITLE: How do i (21f) get over my envy/jealousy?
POST: I've always known I wasn't a looker. I know I'm too skinny, tiny boobs, tiny butt, too tall, too this and too that. Whatever. Not everyone can be Jennifer Aniston or Kim Kardashian. Thats cool. But i thought that if a man wanted to sleep with you and be in a relationship with you, at least he thought you were pretty to him...

Well, when i found out that wasn't true, it kind of messed with my head. I already knew i wasn't attractive, so why would i be surprised that my boyfriend thinks the same? But it sucks and it hurts and it makes me so, so jealous of other, beautiful women. Including my sisters. 

It started with just little comments from my boyfriend. When he wasn't even angry. He'd just point out stuff. Someone told me that i had a sexy voice and he said he'd heard sexier. He's said he preferred different boobs but mine are good enough, that other girls have better hips or hair or style or are prettier or would make him too stupid so he's happy he's with me. 

And i get that thats all messed up stuff to say to someone else, but its not like it was all at one time and it was a year and a half ago that he basically stopped that behavior and now tells me I'm beautiful and stuff but i don't believe him and i don't think anyone will ever think that and I'm so jealous of girls with boyfriends who can't keep their hands off each other. I want passion. I want to be that girl.

But i never will be and i need to just be a big girl and accept that, but it really sucks and it really hurts and i feel so stupid and pathetic at the same time. How do i just accept that i will not be physically attractive and that's alright?
TL;DR:
