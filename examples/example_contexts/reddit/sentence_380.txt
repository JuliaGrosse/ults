TITLE: I(20M) Bumped into an old friend(20f) not sure if I might be crossing a line.
POST: So I just started school in my home state and it turns out I have class with a really good friend from awhile back that ended, I would say painfully/unpleasantly.

I met (20F) around middle schools and we became "bf and gf" (as much as that is in middle school) I like her a lot and even when we broke up we usually talked and hung out quite a bit. however one day I kinda just stopped talking to her, and even when she made quite explicit attempts to reconnect I ignored them ( this was around soph. year of high school). The reason being is that I had to change from my mother's house to my father's and he was extremely abusive. I felt like I didn't want to be around anyone one after that, I was convinced that I would hurt them and I was embarrassed about my home life. I used to be a really out-going charismatic and fun guy, but after living with my father for a short 2-3 years father's I was essentially dead inside. I could never even imagine having the time that I had had back then. thus I never tried to get back in touch. I pretty confident that I hurt her, however maybe she doesn't see it that way at all?

When I saw her today, I said hi and gave her a hug, told her it was good to see her and got her number so we could keep in touch. However when class ended she left quickly and made no attempt to say anything. I'm not sure if it means nothing or not. I'd really like to just sit down with her and at least say sorry. I feel quite bad about it. I'd like to know how to best handle the situation, my plan was to call her and meet her for coffee around lunch sometime next week apologize and then hopefully catch up and maybe set a precedent for another meet.
Let me know what you think, I appreciate it.
