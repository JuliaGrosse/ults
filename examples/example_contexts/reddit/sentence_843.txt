TITLE: Getting mixed signals from 25M (I'm 24F). Dated three weeks, acquaintances for a year. Help?
POST: Went on a few dates with him and things are going okay - it's honest, straightforward, and no games. Two of our friends are in a serious relationship so that's how we know each other. We genuinely enjoy each other's company. 

Date 3 rolls around, we're at his place, and he says something along the lines of "I've been having fun being with you and I've been looking forward to seeing you all week, but I have to confess, I'm not falling in love with you." I'm gutted and say that "good thing, because I was starting to fall for you", but we mutually decide to go back to being just friends and left it at that. This was Friday night.

Fast forward to Monday (I cried and drank a bottle of wine to feel the rejection out, and then resolved to move on Sunday.). I get a text sending me hugs, love, and butterflies (flowery language isn't uncommon from him, but it's very lovey-dovey) which then confused the shit out of me. I replied in a friendly fashion and have resolved that he's doing all the initiating from now on. My attachment was nipped in the bud by saying what he said, but now I'm confused. I miss the days when we were straightforward and I knew what to expect. None of this 'friends on Friday' and then'sending me love' on Monday. 

Where do I go from here? Do I reset boundaries when I see him next (because that conversation isn't exactly text-appropriate) or just let him figure his shit out while I keep living my life as I did before we started seeing each other? Someone has suggested cutting him out completely (more like telling him to go fuck himself), but I really don't want that :(
TL;DR:
