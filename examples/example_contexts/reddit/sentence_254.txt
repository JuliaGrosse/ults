TITLE: How do I tell my FWB [F 30] that I [M 25] don't want to be in a relationship with her unless she loses weight?
POST: I've been friends with her since I started college at 21 and we are both seniors now and we have been FWB since the last 4 years on and off. Well she came over earlier in the week and talked to me about possibly dating and maybe having it turn into something long-term. The thing is, the way she has been, I never would think of her as someone I'd want to date. She isn't that fat (I would guess 160 lbs, 5'7'') but I date women that are more active and into physical activities that I like to do (mountain bike, jogging, swimming).

Part of doing these types of things also gets you in shape. I would wish she would at least get a little more fit. I just don't want her to get the basic notion that I don't want to be with a fat chick. So, how should I talk to her about this, I had never had to deal with this kind of talk before and have no idea how I would bring it up.
TL;DR:
