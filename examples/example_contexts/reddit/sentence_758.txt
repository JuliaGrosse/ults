TITLE: So, what did you do when you were a young whippersnapper or hooligan?
POST: I was walking with my friends and snapped a windshield wiper on someone's car. *Oooooh*, I know big time trouble. The person saw me do it. We ran back to my house. About half an hour later, my other friend's Mom (who had been at the library) came over & said "The cops are looking for you.) No kidding, the cops were looking for me (I am now a wanted criminal). Anyways, the car owner decided to take my parents to small claims court. We won because my Father said the wiper was already broken (it was some fancy wiper that was supposed to retract or something, and if it were functioning properly, it would not have been out in the open tempting me to snap it in the first place). 

I'm sure reddit has some far more interesting stories, so let's share!
TL;DR:
