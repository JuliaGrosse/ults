TITLE: girlfriend [23f] broke up with me [23m] because "it's what she needs to do right now." Does this make sense to others? Anybody gone through this before?
POST: She broke up with me because she feels like it is something she needs to do at this time. Her words were, "I need to be able to take care of myself before I can take care of somebody else." We've been together for just under three years and she claims to still love me, but says that I shouldn't wait for her and that if I find somebody else that makes me happy to go for it.

I asked her whether she still wants to make this work, and she says "yes, if whenever I'm ready and you happen to still be willing to make this work, I would love to be with you."

I thought about the possibility of her wanting to see what else is out there in terms of partners, but she claims that "I don't want to date others and do not want to sleep around."

She even took it to the point of saying that "we can still be faithful to each other, but owe it to let the other know if that ever changes."

Not sure what other females think of this? Is this a way of her "not hurting me"? Have any other females gone through something like this? And then had it work out down the line?
TL;DR:
