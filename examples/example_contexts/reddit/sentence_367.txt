TITLE: Hurtful gf (24)
POST: Hey all, I think I've posted here before about another issue but store is my gf and I (m24) have been dating the most of 10 years and she's always been hurtful. If she has a bad day she'll be hurtful to me if I'm not there immediately. Like today, I'm working and she's had a day off and I ask her during the day how her day has been and she says it's ok. I get home at 330 and she says come over and I say I'm having a rest for an hour and she's annoyed at that telling me to fuck off and stuff. Anyway she doesn't reply and she told me the day before she needs to be at work for something so I think she's not replying because she's at work. Turns out she's asleep. She wakes up later going off at me for not being there yet and I try and explain to her why I'm not there which is because I think she's still at work so I haven't left yet I hadn't heard from her in over 3 hours. She keeps saying hurtful things like why don't we just break up and general hurtful things which she doesn't need to say. I get to hers after I finally know what's going on and she's still like this. She wants me to just read her mind and understand she had a bad day when she's told me the exact opposite.

How can I stop her from being so hurtful all the time? I tell her I love her all the time and I show her I love her and I get nothing but pain in return half the time. When we have these fights about nothing I just feel like my heart sinks and all my energy is being sacked out of me. When I tell her how much she hurts me she says everything fucking hurts me. The only thing that hurts me is her.

And I know I'm saying it as if it's the only thing she does but it's not,  she is loving and kind sometimes but it's like she has to much hate in her, I think she finds it hard to express those good feelings towards me.
TL;DR:
