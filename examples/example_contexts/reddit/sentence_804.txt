TITLE: When you've been assured that a girl has the same feeling you have, is it alright to just ask here to be "more than friends"?
POST: unfortunately, I can't really ask her to go anywhere this week because of how busy we are in school and that we are low income teenagers. However, I've hung out with her after school a lot and got to really know each other. I mean like, being comfortable enough to discuss personal things and even made her cry because I've asked her about something emotional( It was later confirmed through a friend that she was happy she was comfortable enough to do that in front of me). The same friend told me that she has the same feeling I do, so I was just wondering if it would be ok to just straight up ask her to be my girlfriend. I've picked out somewhere private and something meaningful to say. Should I do it? Is this the best approach to the situation I'm dealing with.
TL;DR:
