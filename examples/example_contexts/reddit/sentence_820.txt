TITLE: I [21F] just had a baby with my fiance [25M] and ever since he has become incredibly mean to me and calls me a bitch or cunt almost daily. Is this normal?
POST: My fianc√© and I got engaged while I was 4 months pregnant after being together for 2 years. At the beginning Of our relationship he was kind of a dick to me and we broke up for a while. I felt like he changed so we got back together. Shortly after I got pregnant and he seemed like a changed man during the pregnancy. 

Since we've had the baby he is mean to me almost everyday. I get called names like bitch, cunt, stupid, idiot etc. Our daughter is only 3 months old, but he screams at me and calls me names in front of her and I don't want her to think that is okay. 

 He isn't very hands on with the baby and I practically have to beg him to hold her so I can bathe or brush my teeth or do anything by myself. I also just want him to hold her because he wants to, but the only times he ever offers to hold her are when other people are around. 

I am a stay at home mom so he supports both of us which isn't easy, but I don't feel like it's okay to talk down to me all the time. I think he has a lot of pressure on him as the only money maker. He says that I don't respect him, but I really do and I thank him for (mostly) everything he does for me and our daughter. 

Our relationship isn't all bad and we really can have a great time together, but he just snaps on me in an instant and we can go from laughing to screaming so quickly. 

I'm starting to think this is kind of like verbal abuse. I really need advice. I don't want to talk to my friends or family about this either so reddit is my only outlet. Is there something I can do to make him see how badly it hurts me to be talked down to?
TL;DR:
