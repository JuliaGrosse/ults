TITLE: I [33/f] with my [36/m] together 2 years. Question about finances.
POST: I have a great boyfriend in a lot of ways. However, currently I earn six figures and own my own house and he is living with me. At times he's offered to pay for the electricity bill which is really nothing.  Maybe not relevant, I also have children that I provide for and am their sole parent. Anyway, he doesn't earn much so it's never bugged me and I've never asked him to contribute. I should mention he does by household goods and groceries frequently.

Well, the other night he mentioned he wanted to buy something that costs approx $1,000 to replace a broken iPad. My thought is if he can afford to but something fun for that amount he should be contributing financially. Thoughts on this?
