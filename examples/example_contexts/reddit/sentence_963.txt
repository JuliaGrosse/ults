TITLE: I'm [25 M] starting to fall for a coworker [24 F] though I have a girlfriend [24 F] of a few years
POST: So I'll try to keep this short. I've been dating my girlfriend for a few years now. It's been great so far, and there's not much I can complain about. The relationship itself is strong, there's good communication so fights aren't bad, and the sex life is good. However, it's become somewhat boring in the past year or so. There's still decent conversation but there have been long car rides with few words spoken. It hasn't been awkward but sometimes I wish things could just be a little bit more engaging. 

Cue my coworker. We've been working together for around a year or so now. I've always thought she was kind of cute but that was about it until recently. I've gotten to get to know her in the past 6 months and we have a lot of things in common. We've hung out a bit with mutual friends/coworkers and we've gotten somewhat close. We've held hands but there's been no kissing or sex, and I don't plan on there being as long as I'm with my girlfriend. This girl is fun and exciting and someone I could see myself having a great time with. 

So I'm very torn. On the one hand, I have a good relationship that could honestly end in marriage and it would be nice and complacent. On the other hand, I could take a risk and see what could happen with my coworker. I would hate to hurt my girlfriend but I also don't want to live wondering what if. Should I break up with my girlfriend or end things with my coworker?
TL;DR:
