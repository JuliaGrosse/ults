TITLE: Me [27 M] her [21 F]. Help me figure out the grey area before being exclusive
POST: I'm curious about how y'all treat the time before being exclusive with someone.  I met someone about two weeks ago.  Had a very fun first date that ended with making-out, cuddling at a park and a snuggl'd walk home.  Two days later we have sex (it's awesome) and we've hung out a handful or so of times since then all including her staying over, having sex, cuddling, being kissy, affectionate and fun.  

However, even though she intiatates texting with me, she has yet to ask me to hang out with her.  I've done all of the asking which is starting to annoy me, but also making wonder where we are at.

I have an old FWB that I have ridiculously awesome sexual chemistry with that has been hitting me up.  I want to explore this some more, but I don't want to hurt my new friend's feelings or ruin the potential between us.

Is it best to avoid the old FWB?  Should I ask my new friend where we stand?

I feel like it is too soon to have that conversation and I would only be implying that I want to see other people.

What would you do?  How do you feel about the period before being exclusive?
TL;DR:
