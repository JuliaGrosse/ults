TITLE: my [21F] bf's [22M] brother [25M] with disabilities is living in hoarding situation, and I need advice!
POST: We've been dating for about two years, and only just recently met his family last night, and his adult brother (22 years old) who lives with them and has moderate/severe autism (he has a volunteer job, is communicative at times, but spends a lot of time withdrawn in himself. I'm not sure if he's legally their dependent or not) and both him and his parents are hoarders. 

They're not terrible people, they're all kind and generous, but what I saw was horrific, and that was after (I was told via my bf) *an extensive cleaning*. So I know their normal situation is much, much worse. I was afraid to eat or drink anything at their house and was clearly in shock and probably made the worst first impression, but what's more important right now is that I really think Adult Protective Services need to be called.

But I've never been in this sort of situation, and I have no clue what the fallout is going to be from this. Will they help in the form of councilors and clean up, or straight up remove the brother from their home? Should I tell my boyfriend? If I don't, will it be traced back to me? Will calling even *do* anything, as the brother's a hoarder too? The local APS website provides nothing substantial other than their phone number and operating hours.

Does anyone who's gone through something similar have any advice on what will happen when I call? I'm kind of just lost right now.
TL;DR:
