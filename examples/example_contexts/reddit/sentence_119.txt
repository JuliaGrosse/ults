SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I'm [F/19] going to a Halloween party tonight that my ex [M/19] will be at. Help.
POST: [Here] is my post where I basically detailed everything about the relationship.

We broke up about three weeks ago. I saw him two weeks ago when he gave me some of my stuff back. Other than that, I haven't seen him at all, even around campus.

The party is at his fraternity house, and I was invited by a different brother. I asked a lot of his brothers if I should go and if it would be appropriate for me to go and they've all said yes. They are all my friends as well. I said I didn't want anything to be weird and I was met with "it's only weird if you make it weird. And he will have to handle it like a reasonable adult because we have mutual friends."

I could not go to this party but it's Halloween and I need to get out of my apartment and go. I feel like this is just something I have to do. 

I really could use some advice or wise words on how I can handle this situation. What if he tries to talk to me? I could "what if" all day, really. What should my mindset be? Help.
TL;DR:
