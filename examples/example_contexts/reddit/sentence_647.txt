TITLE: My siblings (36F|39M) won't let me (28F) pay them back for things.
POST: We recently went on a family vacation, and we (me and my siblings) agreed to foot the bill for our parents, but split equally among us three.

However, my siblings both seemingly don't want the full amount from me. They say things like, "Oh, forget about it", or "You can just pay for ______ while I pay for ______." If we were to do it this way, our individual contributions would be roughly proportional to our household incomes.

Yet I feel uneasy about this. On the one hand, I do make the least money and it's kind of great to not have to pay as much (I'm pretty frugal and wouldn't have chosen the more expensive accommodation options).

On the other hand, I feel like my siblings' spouses don't particularly like me, or even see me as a mooch. I've always been the baby of the family due to being significantly younger. I also feel like I haven't balanced my debts, like I will still owe them something, or that my brother-in-law or sister-in-law will grumble, "Why are you still paying for OP's portion for ________"?

They sometimes pick up other small things, like lunches and dinners, that I have done with less frequency, because we have family things at their houses most of the time.

If I try to insist to pay them, they get kind of angry. What should I do? What's fair?
TL;DR:
