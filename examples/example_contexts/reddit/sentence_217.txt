TITLE: Aerospace Engineers of Reddit: I've got a question. What do you do in your job?
POST: I'm currently in year 10, hoping to go into a career working around and with helicopters, planes, or anything that flies. I'm looking into studying with the ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) largely because huge amounts of alleviated stress concerning fees, living costs and the such.

So my question is: What do you do in your job? It's a huge question for me, because I would absolutely love to be a job where I was directly working on aircraft (helis especially) in a mechanical or design aspect, or flying around in them (though I'm short sighted, so the odds aren't good). 

Basically, I would absolutely loathe to be sitting behind a desk all day directing people, or thinking about some completely boring but probably terribly important aspect of flying; I'd much rather get down and dirty with an engine or maintain aircraft, or design parts or engines to be more efficient/faster/stronger.

For my year 12 subjects, I'll be studying physics, chemistry, english, systems engineering and all three levels of maths from low level to high level. I'm no dummy by any means, and do very well academically, so it's not a huge issue in that department.

I'm wondering whether any of you can tell me about what you do or give me advice on what career path I should perhaps focus on instead, whether it be mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering, I really don't know.
TL;DR:
