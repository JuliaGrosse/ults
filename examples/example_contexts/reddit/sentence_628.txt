TITLE: 24m trying to survive my 20's as all my college friends are moving away
POST: I've been out of school for a year now but more and more of my friends have been moving away. I do live with one of my best college friends and we hang out and stuff and we have some friends who've stuck around but I really only hang out if my roommate makes the plans. He's a social butterfly - plays in 2 bands and 2 hockey teams. I'm more introverted - I like my down time, especially on weekdays as my teaching job keeps me busy. I know for a fact I don't have that kind of energy to maintain those commitments. 

I know you'll just say find a hobby but I'm just not really interested in specific stuff - I kinda just like chilling not anything specific like playing hockey or music. I have a girlfriend and the relationship is great because it's not one where it drains on my free time to meet other people, I just don't know where to start. 

I'm kind of a contradiction - I talk for a living conversing with students but I just don't like to be the center of attention and start conversations at a bar or whatever. 

I live in a midsize city so finding people is no issue it's just finding stuff that I want to do within the short precious weekend time I have. 

Any suggestions would be awesome to get over this seemingly typical mid 20s funk. Thanks
