TITLE: TIFU by thinking I know my way around town
POST: This happened about two years ago on Halloween night. I was at band practice, and nobody came to pick me up. Instead of asking for a phone like a sensible person I decided to walk home in the dark. I took a left instead of a right at one turn, and ended up getting lost. For 3 hours. I ended up in the shadier parts of town, which freaked me out. I ended up walking halfway around my town, and somehow ended up near a church that's literally a block from my house. I ran home, and my stepmom was on the porch waiting from me. It being Halloween night, she thought that I was out partying. I tried telling her the truth, but she partied as a teen and she thought I was lying. This obviously made me mad, mainly because I'm not the party type. This ended up in me being grounded for what felt like forever.
TL;DR:
