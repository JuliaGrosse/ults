TITLE: I [23f] am attracted to my best friend's [23f] ex boyfriend [25m]- how to talk to her about it
POST: Hi R_A,
As you guessed from the title, I am falling for my best friend's ex from 4 years ago. 

The background info:
When they were dating we all hung out pretty frequently. I liked him in a friendly way, nothing more. They broke up early 2009. He and I hung out a few times after they broke up, it seemed like he needed someone to talk to. I realized I started having feelings for him and decided he and I couldn't talk anymore. I didn't feel right about dating my friend's ex that close to their breakup.
He moved away, I finished college. Fast forward to a few weeks ago- he contacted me and we got together for a drink. And again for coffee a week later. At this point he said he had feelings for me and I did, too. We've spent time together since, and I'm realizing that I could be really serious about him. 

The point:
Therefore, I am realizing I need to tell my friend about this. But I have no idea how. She is like family and I want to do this thing right. 
I would hope that she would be happy for me but I'm really nervous about a bad reaction. I wouldn't be, except she was in a similar but way shittier situation in high school; she cut the perpetrators out of her life. As if that weren't enough, I tend to have trouble communicating with people in general. 
How do you suggest I talk to her about this? What do I say so that she doesn't take it personally?
TL;DR:
