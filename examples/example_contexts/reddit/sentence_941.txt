TITLE: Lost 50 pounds. I look better but I'm kinda feeling like a prick.
POST: I had been in some bad habits: eating crap and sitting on my ass. I got up to 235 pounds and broke up with my girlfriend. That's when I decided to change my lifestyle.

I began biking to work instead of taking the bus. I used to play basketball in high school (im 32 now) so I started playing again regularly. Also I started counting calories with an app on my phone and I am disciplined about sticking to my calorie limit.

Now it's 6 months later and I am down to 185. I feel the changes I've made are permanent changes so I don't see myself going back to my old unhealthy ways. I feel good; I look a lot better; and I am still losing weight at a steady pace. All good stuff but I do have one problem:

I have grown extremely judgemental of overweight people. I know everyone's body is different and some people have glandular issues and there's food addiction and blah blah blah. But I just can't help thinking that if I could lose weight, anyone can do it. It's just a matter of hard work.

 So when I see overweight people, in my head I really hardcore judge them. I just assume that they're lazy because I know I got fat because I was lazy. I work with a lot of overweight people and I have some family members who are overweight and sometimes they just disgust me. 

I don't know what I want from reddit out of this post. I feel bad for judging people but I just can't get these thoughts out of my head. Any replies are welcome. Feel free to call me an asshole if you want, or feel free to empathize.
TL;DR:
