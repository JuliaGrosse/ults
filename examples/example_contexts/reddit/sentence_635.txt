TITLE: I'm new at my job and witnessed an underage coworker drinking on the job. How should I handle this?
POST: I don't want to disclose any identifiable information, but in our state no one under 21 years can pour or consume alcohol, and no employee under 21 can go behind the bar. My coworker, we'll call her Jessica, has broken these rules just out of sight of our managers. 

Jessica is only 18 and she walks into the bar area (where she isn't legally allowed to be) whenever she wants, and this week she was serving a coworker and drank quite a bit of the beer  our coworker ordered. Right in front of me, the coworker who payed for the beer, and two other servers. 

Jessica also spends a lot of time in the kitchen telling everyone how she came to work drunk today. She does this pretty much every day, morning or evening.

I'm the new person at work, I haven't even been there a month yet. I don't know what I should do. I'm afraid we could lose our liquor license if her behavior continues, but I'm also afraid of her finding out I told our manager the truth. I haven't said anything to my boss yet because I'm really not sure how I should handle this. 

What do you think? I know I should probably tell my boss, but how should I go about doing so? I don't want everyone at work to think I'm a jerk or a snitch. I drink too (although I'm not underage), I smoke pot, I don't give a shit what this girl does at home, but every time she drinks while on the clock she puts my job and income (I'm a waitress/bartender) at risk and I think that's more important.
TL;DR:
