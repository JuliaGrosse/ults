TITLE: My [38/F] bf[26/M] called me a c*nt last night
POST: We have been together 3 years it's been a really rocky relationship. Lately stuff been going really well. 

He was helping me compose a long letter to my boss about a work trip I have to go on, he writes a lot better than I do and this was a task that he volunteered doing even though I didn't ask him. 

We ended up getting into some argument about whether or not Venezuela was a poorer country than Ecuador. Really stupid I know, but I told him I had been to both countries and even if Venezuela had more money technically, visually it looks a lot poorer there. 

He ended up flat out calling me a cunt. Like didn't say "stop being such a cunt" he just goes, "you're a cunt."

Not that one is better than the other.

He certainly has verbally abused me in the past. I've been called stupid by him and so on, but never have I been described as being a "cunt" by anyone. And furthermore, he is extremely adamant about the word "bitch". Like for example,  he would get mad if I was in line at Target or something, and let's just say hypothetically the cashier bothered me, I would say to him in the parking lot- "wow that lady was really a bitch". He would get really angry that I use that word to describe a woman. 

So my point to him is, if other women can't be called bitch, because he considers it degrading, why is it ok to describe the woman he loves as a cunt? He thinks the words are totally different.

How?

He just texted me, and said I was being a cunt, that's why he called me that, and to stop being so sensitive about it. This reasoning really bothers me. 

Am I wrong here? He says I'm bullying him into a fight over this.
TL;DR:
