TITLE: Question for you armchair cat psychologists
POST: Just wondering if someone here is good at interpreting cat behavior. I adopted an adult male cat about two months ago, and he's awesome. But as the weeks have drawn on, he's grown less interested in getting petted or cuddling, and more interested in playing. The thing is, he'd way rather play with me than a toy.

Here's a typical interaction: He meows at me to get my attention. I look over or get up, and he leads me to the kitchen. I follow him and try to pet him, he responds with some playful swats. I reciprocate, then I have to lay off because he's got sharp claws and I'm made of flesh. I try to sub in a toy and he has no interest, so he walks away. As he walks away, food catches his eye and he stops for a bite. Then we repeat the process.

As recently as last week he was very insistently meowing at me to pick him up, but he doesn't do that as much right now. He also doesn't purr with the force he did recently.

I guess my question is what does this behavior indicate? Has he grown more comfortable with me as an owner, or somehow resentful? Can cats even feel and express resent? Does he long for a second cat to play with? Is he bored?
TL;DR:
