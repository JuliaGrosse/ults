TITLE: My [18/f] Boyfriend [19/m] is always busy and barely makes time for me because his degree is more intense than mine, what do I do?
POST: My boyfriend (19) is really busy all the time with the copious amounts of work he has to do for his math degree so I only end up getting to see him once a week- if i'm lucky. 
I love him a lot and there are stretches throughout the semester when I do get to see him often and then life is good but there are times when I end up only seeing him if I place myself in his line of vision. A lot of the time I end up watching him do calculus or algebra work where he barely speaks to me. 
As much as i'd like to talk to him about it, I fear that he'll only think I don't understand the commitment required to his program. That and my lack of patience could make him feel like i'm just being needy. He's a very logical person who only thinks things through without much emotion involved. So budgeting time for me wouldn't make sense to him when calc and algebra assignments take precedent. 
To be fair, when he is present in our relationship he's very considerate and pays attention to me. He's a very loving guy but he just doesn't understand what it does to me every time he puts me back on the shelf.
TL;DR:
