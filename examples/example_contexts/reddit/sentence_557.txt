SUBREDDIT: r/offmychest
TITLE: Yes
POST: That one word. It's three letters, but it makes me so ridiculously, over-the-top happy! I can't believe it! A week ago, I asked this girl who I've had what can only be described as a "mutual like-ship" with to be my girlfriend. She said she'd have to think about, see about her parents and whatnot. It hurt for some reason. She didn't say no, but it did.

But that doesn't matter! She said yes! Now I know what you're thinking reddit, "this kid is just in high school. He doesn't know anything about anything yet." And you know what? That's true. But I don't care! I'm happy! Two years ago when I started high school I didn't even begin to fathom that this could happen. I hated myself. I was an introvert that felt that no one could like me. I thought I wasn't good enough. I didn't even have the ability to talk to girls. I didn't think I was that type of guy with that ability. But now I have my first girlfriend! She makes me happy! All that stress I get with as many APs as I'm taking just goes away when I talk to her. Those 4 minutes I have completely alone with her everyday is the highlight of me day! I got motivated to change myself (part of why I made an account on reddit), and now I get to be in a relationship with someone who makes me want to keep improving even more!

I'm young. For obvious reasons, what I'm experiencing is probably fleeting. But that one word just made all the difference. I know it's stupid, but I don't care! She's awesome and I'm so ridiculously glad this is happening.
TL;DR:
