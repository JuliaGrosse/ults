SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: Now we know what you know, but what is the darkest secret SOMEONE ELSE knows about YOU that makes you cringe knowing they do?  I'll start.
POST: This is pretty tame by comparison to some of the comments from the [first post,] but here it goes.

First off, disclaimer: I'm a bi-curious guy who keeps a very straight persona, but is in no way homophobic or bigoted unlike a lot of the straight acting, gay bashing, closeted jerks that seem to keep coming up on here.
 
So, my gay friend and I went down to visit another friend of ours for his bachelor party and after a night of lots of drinking and partying we went back to the hotel room we were sharing.  Once back and in separate beds I thought that because he was a good friend of mine and gay that I should tell him all about my homosexual encounters.  I then proceeded to open up about how the night before I was in a threesome with a guy and his wife, blew the guy, loved it; I told him about the other times where I've blown two guys at once etc. (not intriguing enough by Reddit standards).  Next morning, wake up, realize I probably didn't dream that drunken conversation last night and ask him how long we'd been chatting the night before and he responded, long enough for you to tell me you've deepthroated an 8" inch cock.  Now he'll occasionally send me texts asking how the dick sucking business is coming along.
TL;DR:
