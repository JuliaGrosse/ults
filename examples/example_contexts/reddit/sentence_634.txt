TITLE: [NY]Went for Free Annual Physical, Billed for Two Office Visits.
POST: I went for an annual physical with a new doctor who is my PCP. She asked me if anything was bothering me and I told her I had a slight plain in my foot. The Doctor said to try stretching it and make another appointment if it keeps hurting. She wrote it down in my file and told me that was only to put down as much information as possible to justify the other blood tests she was running to the insurance company. 

Weeks later her office is charging me for two office visits for that one time because I mentioned having foot pain. Insurance paid for most of it but I have to pay the remainder. 

The doctor never told me at the time of the visit that mentioning pain would change the nature of the visit. Does this count as fraud? What should I do?
TL;DR:
