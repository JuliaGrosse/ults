TITLE: Me[21M] with [19F]. Dating 4 months. Cheating emotionally or physically? Over thinking?
POST: My girlfriend (19f) and I (21m) have been dating for four months. I'm honestly a jealous guy. She went to a party with her friends from college and came back with a new guy "friend". They snap chat and text. Idk what they talk about but she says just "hey what's up". I caught her in a lie before about talking to her ex boyfriend bc she doesn't wanna give up her friends.  I know the ex still wants her and the new guy likes her. She says it doesn't matter as long as she knows that their just friends. I'm tired of stressing over it. Can't stop thinking about what she's really talking about with this new guy since they send pictures through snap chat.
TL;DR:
