TITLE: My boyfriend (20) was kissed when drunk at party by another boy (17) and I saw and the image is stuck in my head! :'(
POST: Hi, so me and my boyfriend have been strong since the ft we met 30.10.15 and have got stronger over the months. It's been hard as I live 1h 20min away so we've had our moments together to realise the pain and stress of not living close. I now work in his town and stay at his quite often so it's getting better :)

Last night it was our friends bday party and we went to her house for drinks. I had a drink and tried this milkshake alcohol and something didn't go down right which meant I was sick and throwing up endlessly for a long time, I decided to take a break and go to my BFs house for some quite and then go back later to catch the taxi to the club. My bf stayed there as didn't want him missing out because of me, I felt better so headed back to our friends house..

When I got there everyone was outta it.. I found my boyfriend half asleep and pretty drunk on a sun lounge bed and this boy sitting on top of him kissing him. This boy was our friends new BFF which last night was the first time meeting him and I had joked about him wanting to touch my bf but didn't think it would actually happen. I walked away and the boy realised and walked away to, everyone reassured me than my bf didn't want it but he was to outta it to try push him off him for it to stop. My bf can't stop saying sorry and can't stop punching and throwing things and crying in anger about what happened. 

Now this image is stuck in my head, I can't sleep, I can't stop crying and I don't know what to say. Every time my bf or I wanna sit on top (just in general chilling ect.) I'm gonna remember that moment, I haven't even kissed him since because I just wanna cry! I love him and literally can't live without him!! :'(
TL;DR:
