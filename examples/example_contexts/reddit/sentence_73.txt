TITLE: I [18F] gave my boyfriend [22M] an ultimatum, was I wrong to?
POST: So Joe and I have been dating for a few months after meeting online. It's been going pretty well so far, considering we live about 2 hours apart and are both busy with school. Because of this, we are in an open relationship. Both of us are free to sleep with other people if we use protection and tell the other person about it. This has been working, no problems so far. 

I've returned home for the summer, which means that the distance between us is now even further, 5 hours, so we can't see each other as frequently as we used to. We had a talk about what we were going to do over the summer. Both of us agreed that we'd continue the open relationship we had now, but there was an argument over condom use. 

I told him that if he at any point didn't use a condom we would break up and I didn't want to see him anymore, which I thought was fairly reasonable. However he didn't know if he could keep that promise, arguing that if he got super drunk or something he might forget but he'd always get tested before sleeping with me again. 

I got really upset that he couldn't even promise me to have safe sex and told him there were three options: promise to use a condom, he always does and everyone is happy; promise to use a condom and break the promise, which means break up and no contact; or don't make the promise, we break up but stay friends. 

Was I wrong in making these absolutes? Joe got really upset and indecisive like he always does when it comes to choices, saying how he doesn't want to lose me but doesn't trust himself either. I feel bad making him choose an option he doesn't like, but I also feel like I'm not asking for too much.
TL;DR:
