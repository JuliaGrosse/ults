TITLE: [22/m] Thinking of breaking up with [22/f] of 2 years, has all her belongings at mine. Need advice
POST: Hello sub. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

This has been a long time coming and maybe I've been delaying it for a while now, but I'm feeling like this relationship isn't going to work out.
I still do care deeply for her, but now I don't believe we are right for each other. She's an absolutely great person but we have our differences, not just what we like but our morals, values and culture. We've had talks about this before and I always believed if we tried to accommodate to each others likings we would be fine. 

But I'm now worn out, I'm frankly tired of trying to like the things that she likes and loosing time and money for things that I would want to do (She's not really keen in my interests though she has tried).
She's been away for holidays for a while now and has left all her belongings at mine as I agreed to help her move out to a new place when she got back. She would be staying at mine until then (few weeks) This was before I felt like we needed to break up. I too went overseas for holidays for a while and I had time to think for myself.

I need your thoughts on what to do sub. I did promise I'd help her move out and don't really want to break up while she doesn't have a place to stay. There's also a few celebrations coming up that I don't think I would be able to celebrate with her, I feel horrible..but I'm thinking of telling her today after work.
TL;DR:
