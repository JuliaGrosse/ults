TITLE: Reddit, why do we faint in response to pain/physical shock? Is it a physiological response or a psychological one?
POST: Alright so I was wondering, why is it that we faint in response to pain? At first, I thought it was just a response to excruciating pain that the mind couldn't handle (or something or other along those lines). But that didn't seem to check out entirely.

See, what got me wondering this whole thing was I remembered an instance from a few years ago. I was playing baseball, and I tried to bunt for a base hit. If you don't know, that means I hide it and square really late, to use both speed and the element of surprise to leg out a base hit. Well, the guy was throwing roughly 90 mph, and he buzzed me up and in. It was coming straight at my face, and since I squared late, I didn't have enough time to really get out of the way. Naturally, I put the bat up and blocked my face. It worked, except the ball hit directly on the middle finger of my right hand.

Well as you can imagine, it wasn't pretty. My finger ballooned to the size of a hot dog wiener in about two minutes. In fact, it got so fat that the top layer of my skin split just from sheer pressure. 

Now while it looked disgusting, it wasn't nearly as painful as you'd expect. It was bleeding everywhere, and it did hurt, but by no means was I in this earth shattering amount of pain (I actually tried to step back in the box before I realized it was hurting about 30 seconds later). Yet while I was at the hospital, about 30-45 minutes later, I suddenly became very thirsty, my vision blurred a little bit, I started seeing stars, and I got a little jelly-legged. I didn't faint, but I was very damn near to it, and the nurse made sure to sit me down before it happened. 

This story seems to kind of rule out the "pain" theory. There has to be something else going on. So why is it that we faint in response to pain or physical shocks?
TL;DR:
