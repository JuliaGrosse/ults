TITLE: Me [38 M] wants to separate from my wife of 9 years. Don't know how to even start that discussion
POST: Hi Reddit, I am married with a 2-yr old kid. I was never truly in love with my wife and always looked at the marriage as something that needs to be done as part of being a human being. This is partly due to my Asian heritage. But now I feel that I am being dishonest to my wife as well as myself.

We are quite different people. For example, I have a totally different set of hobbies, interests, etc., and I want to do many of these activities with a companion. I want to go backpacking in Asia, want to go hiking, but my wife hates these things. Worse still, she doesn't want me to go out with anyone unless they are males. (I can't even go back to meet my parents in my home country regularly because my wife doesn't like that.) I feel that I am losing precious time and will never be able to fulfill my dreams this way.

After thinking a lot, I have decided that I want to bring this up with my wife. The problem is that she is very suspicious of everything I do. So if I bring this up, she is likely to think that I am having an affair and that's why I want to separate. No sane discussion will happen from that point onward.

Just to be sure, I am going to make the lives of my wife and my kid financially secure. That will mean I will give up on a lot of my retirement savings but that's the price I am willing to pay.

I am totally clueless whether we should meet a marriage councilor for this or I should see a psychologist first. I don't know anyone who went to a marriage councilor. This is an alien situation for me. My friends who got divorced had a pretty clean-cut break up where they just walked out. I don't want to be a ruthless person like that.
TL;DR:
