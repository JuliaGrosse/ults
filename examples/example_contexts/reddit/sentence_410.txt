TITLE: How do I (f/19) go about reconnecting with an old bestfriend (f/18)?
POST: This friend (Allie) and I were great friends since 7th grade up to last December. I sort of stopped connecting with her since I started college and she was still going to community college in our hometown. I felt like I couldn't relate to her anymore and when I tried talking to her again it felt like she didn't like me. 

In December Allie invited me to her brother's concert which I happily brought along my friend. My other friend got a text message from her friend who was helping with the concert that she didn't want me to go. I got dressed and went still since that was what I was going to do. Our interactions were awkward and strained and I have not talked to her since. 

Lately, I've been wanting to talk to her and see how she was doing. I thought I wouldn't care but something compels me to see her. So today I contacted her to do a temporary tattoo since she does those in exchange for money. I was hoping to reconnect with her at this time. Does anyone have tips on how I should do this? Or should I just let the leaves fall. Thank you
