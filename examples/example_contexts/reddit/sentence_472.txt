TITLE: Any interesting hospital stories?
POST: Yay for a hospital story.. My cousin and I were being fucking retarded and were punching each other and kicking each other. I hid behind the island in our kitchen and she came up behind me and kicked my hip. It hurt a bit, but I got over it. FOUR DAYS LATER I guess I bruised my hip muscle and apparently I also cut myself and got a Staph infection in my blood (I guess you can get it even through a paper cut?) and it went right to that bruised hip muscle and I couldn't even walk. I went to the doctor and he didn't know what the fuck was wrong with me, so we had blood work done and my white cell count was normal. Well, shit. I started having leg spasms and once my fever reached 103.2, I went to the Emergency Department and was admitted to the hospital. Oh, and I had more blood work done later, and it turns out the inflammation in my hip was like 210 instead of a normal 5 or below or something.  It took them like three days to figure out I had an abscess (lol puss pocket thing) in my right hip muscle and they had to drain it with a needle. They drained 1 cc of puss and after I was so sore I couldn't move but FUCKING PHYSICAL THERAPY THE NEXT DAY MADE ME. I had to use a walker, and I could barely fucking move the wheels an inch.  I had to learn to walk again, and after another day and a half of the walker they put me on crutches. The disease lady wanted me to stay for 2 weeks, but fuck that, I had a concert to go to in like eight days. Four days of crutches (finally back at home) and some pain killers later, I was walking okay I guess but I still can't do a fucking sit up right yet and after running I can't walk that great.
TL;DR:
