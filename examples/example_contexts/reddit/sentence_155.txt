TITLE: Me [17 M] with my [17 F] of 2 years broke up. She wants space. How do I get her back?
POST: We were dating for 2 years and we had no problems in our relationship. I left during the summer to visit family in the mid-west during that time I started to lose feelings for her for unknown reasons. I broke up with her 3 or 4 days before her birthday in september like a fucking asshole over skype.

I saw her again once school started back up and immediately started regretting my decisions. We eventually got back together and went to the homecoming dance and were together for about a 3 week period until she told me the day after homecoming that we should really take a break and focus on our friendship and that she needs space.

It has been 3 months that I have been over clingy with her and trying to give her that space but I haven't because she was the only person I could talk to about my problems and I just get in moods where she is all I can think about. But within the last 3 or 4 weeks I have been giving her some space.

She still occasionally tells me that she loves me and I say it back. But a couple days ago I said I love you through text and she told me to not say that, I then asked why and she said "because we are not in a relationship."

I haven't seen her in about 2 weeks. What should I do to attempt to get her back or have her want to talk to me? Do any of you know from experience if the giving space thing works? How should I try talking to her again? She has a Christmas party every year with about 25 friends always and I am in her friend group. Should I try making moves with her there?
