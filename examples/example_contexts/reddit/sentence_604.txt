SUBREDDIT: r/tifu
TITLE: TIFU by hanging out with these groups of people at school for 2 years.
POST: Ok so backstory first; I was 12 (now 14, why am I on reddit??) and my current friends were turning into thugs so I decided to leave them...
I found these new people who were like 20-30 friend squad k
In 8th grade an egyptian kid moved to my school and this year someone did a really REALLY racist thing...

They made an instagram account him and went on random posts saying pretty racist things.
Anyways my friends tell me and I'm not a person that makes fun of those things so I said thats not funny and I didnt laugh.

Anyways the next day I'm on the lunch line and the guy finds out and all my friends say it was me who made the account, which I didnt at all, I barely have internet to post this here.
Flash forward to today, his brother threatens me, saying that he's gonna beat me up, and at the end of school I'm called to the office (I thought it was for putting pictures of my teachers all around his classroom).
I see my friend there and we both say how we had nothing to do with it, and the principal says he's going to open a police investigation about it. Crap.
TL;DR:
