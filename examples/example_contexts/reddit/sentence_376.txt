TITLE: So reddit, there's this girl...
POST: This is what I get for being a gentlemanly, classy guy.

At my college the gender ratio is about 7:1 (guys:girls) and so what happens a lot is that a girl will draw an inordinate amount of attention. This leads to guys (desperate because of the awful ratio) to be generally creepy and stalker-like. So my dilemma is that I, being one of the non creepers, have started attracting girls that want a guy that doesn't creep on them.

Specific occurrence: At the beggining of this semester while I was at the school's dining hall, this girl (that I know) comes up to me and pretty much demands my phone number and gives me her's. I didn't think this was too strange, but my friends who were eating with me said it was pretty obviously a "Let's get together." move by her. Over the next couple of days she sent me mundane texts in a flirty fashion, smiley faces that didn't belong, over blown care about my feelings for being interrupted etc. 

 This morning during my chem 2 lecture one a girl that I know in an ok way, who, on many previous occasions (we work on homework together and have had classes in the past together) said she HATED when people touched her (in any way). So this morning she said she wasn't feeling well and demanded that I feel up her Lymph nodes in her neck. This story doesn't properly portray the amount of aggressiveness that I am feeling from her. 

Would I mind getting to know her better? No, I think she is nice. 

I am freaking out about how she is going about it. YES!

Holy mother of god, I have had girls come onto me before, but never from this direction, and it is starting to put me off.
