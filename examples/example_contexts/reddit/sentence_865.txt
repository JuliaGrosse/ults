TITLE: sexually unhappy[23M] with [23F] 1 1/2 yr gf
POST: Background: 
The first 8-10 months we had sex multiple times a day and it seemed more passionate and energy filled. Now we have sex less, about once a week, but we spend all day in bed when we see each other (prime time for sex). We see each other 3 times a week on average. She also loves me deeply despite me maybe not feeling loved at times.

Problem/questions: 
She doesn't want to have sex as often as me and that's fair but I can't help but feel negative emotions and be somewhat upset when it doesn't happen and I don't know how to over come that or turn my sex drive down or hers up.

Problems pt. 2/My feelings: 
I feel like it's more than just a sexual release like I equate love to sex and her wanting to have less sex with me/she seems less into it makes me feel less loved. I also feel like she kisses me less and is just less all over me and that makes me feel less loved.

I feel like she never initiates sex without me being some sort of catalyst which makes me feel like she is not into me, even though I know she is.

Past attempts at communication: 
I've talked to her about it and she doesn't really like talking about it and when I asked her why things seem to be different than how they used to be she says we were in the honey moon phase. She also once said how it's different now that I live at home (just graduated)[despite: my parents not caring, us both having our own rooms on the opposite side of the house, and having had sex at my house countless times before without her mentioning this once].
TL;DR:
