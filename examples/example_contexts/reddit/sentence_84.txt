SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My(21F) boyfriend (25M) just walked out on me.
POST: We've been dating for 6 months, knew each other for over a year.

We had gotten in a big fight about two months ago because he was paranoid I was cheating on him (even though we'd spend almost every night together). We split up for a few days and got back together, but it was never the same after that. I guess just knowing he doesn't trust me at all, for no reasons other than his own insecurities and paranoia, has made me start questioning our relationship.

Anyway, I'm trying to make it work because I really care about this guy. He's super sweet, and he really doesn't have a lot of friends or support system. I want to be there for him. But after that fight I just can't get those feelings for him anymore. I never feel like having sex anymore, when we're together I don't want to cuddle much or be intimate. I like being with him but I just can't get in the mood anymore. 

Today we were hanging out in my apartment and he was asking me to cuddle. After some back and forth about it I laid down next to him and he asked if something was wrong. I told him the truth, that I just didn't feel the spark anymore, but I wanted things to work out and I still wanted to be with him. His response was just getting up, getting dressed, and leaving. He texted me a few minutes later saying he'd call me in an hour when he's cooled off. 

I just don't know what to do. Should I even try to salvage this relationship? I want him back but I can't help but feel I'd just be prolonging an inevitable break up. I don't want to string him along either...
TL;DR:
