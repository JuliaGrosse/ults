SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My (17M) girlfriend (17F) of 6 months is going to break up with me because of my mom.
POST: Okay, so this girl is something else and even though i've been dating her for 6 months, it's felt like years. We love each other and planned our future together. We also planned on going to the same college together, she becoming a doctor in zoology and me studying astrophysics/astronomy. We've planned this and marriage after college as well. However, my mother has not liked her since the beginning and I have no clue why. My girlfriend has always been the sweetest and most polite thing ever. She even made them all blankets for Christmas. My mom blames her for everything and treats her like garbage. Everything that I do wrong or I get in trouble for, she blames her. My dad on the other hand, absolutely loves my girlfriend. Because of everything with my mom, my girlfriend cannot take it anymore and has decided that we should separate. My girlfriend has had depression and had/has anxiety and cannot deal with her being the root of all my problems according to my mom. She wishes she could be like me and be strong enough to take it, but she just can't and doesn't want to deal with it anymore. Is there anything we can do to save our relationship? I love her so much and I do not want to lose her all because of my mom.
TL;DR:
