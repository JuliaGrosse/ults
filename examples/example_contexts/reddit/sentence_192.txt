TITLE: Reddit, I am a teenager in need of assistance. Help to  avenge your socially awkward teenage self.
POST: So a little bit about myself. I am a 15 year old sophomore who attends a small private school (<50 kids in high school) and I really need a girlfriend. There was a girl but she has a boyfriend out of state+she has a bit of a crush on one of the seniors, who I truly cannot compete with. But my real problem is that I have no real friends at this school and no girl ever seems to have any interest in me at all. I would like to know why.
Basically I don't consider myself ugly. I am 6'6" and 155lbs so I guess I am a bit skinny, but actually am fairly muscular. I have a slight acne problem, but really at this age who doesn't. For the most part I am quite confident and often called the funniest guy in school. And not even in a class clown type way. I am on the State Champion Basketball team and have a 4.0 GPA.
Sorry for the awful OP, I have had a really bad week and am just rambling/making this up as I go along.
Thanks in advance!
