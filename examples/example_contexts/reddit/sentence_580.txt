POST: Hi Loseit,

Hope all is well and weight lossy,

I have been doing a bit of an experiment around drinking for the last two weeks by staying in a defecit of 100 cals a day and drinking around 150-250 cals of alcohol a day.

I have measured my self and weighed myself,

Last week I lost weight, this week it's gone up, I have lost size around my belly though.

Instead of posting that lean gains link and theorising I was hoping we could have a thread about numbers, anyone gained weight or not lost weight while drinking in a decent defecit?

Anyone lose considerable weight drinking 200-330 cals of booze a day?

What I have noticed is I can eat perfectly if I can drink, if I don't drink then I eat some bad stuff, I seem to have to do one bad thing. I need to pick one to lose the weight I think.

So I know the way the body approaches alcohol and that may make calorie counting irrelevant, I just want to hear facts as in people gaining weight while in a deficit and drinking or not losing or vice versa.

I have yo yod a lot myself, I was 17 stone, got to 14, went back up to 15, got down to 12 and a half, now back up to 14.

When I lose weight I'm usually binge drinking in the weekends, I wnat to be a moderate drinker and drink a few a night and spread out my bad habit, but if people have found drinking in a defecit pointless I'll cut it out for a few months.
TL;DR:
