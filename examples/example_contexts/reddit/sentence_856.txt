TITLE: Unsure of how to find a part time job for the summer. No luck so far
POST: Hey Reddit, I'm a 21 year old female and I can't seem to find a decent summer job.

For the past two summers, I worked at my community college where we had a learning assistance center where I tutored math through calculus. We were always swamped with people who needed help with their summer classes.

 However, when I transferred to a university in January, I lost my job. I tutor for my university currently, but it's individually based instead of hourly like my old job. I finished my semester last week and will start my spring classes that run three days a week from 9-11am.

I fell into my first job because I was good at math and my school recruited me. I'm not sure how to go about looking for a part time summer job. I've applied for a bunch of part time nannying jobs on care.com with no luck. I know I will have to quit for fall semester because I have such a heavy course load.

Any advice for looking for summer time work? I hold an Associate's degree in science. My current university doesnt have much to offer.
TL;DR:
