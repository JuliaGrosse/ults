TITLE: Me [25F] with my boyfriend[29 M] together a year and a half, positive problem, I love his family and mine but, I don't know how to get them all together.
POST: Myself and my boyfriend have been together a year and a half now. I love his family, my family loves him and as far as I can make out his family love me. It's a great situation. 

I am very family orientated. I love family gatherings, birthday parties, anniversaries, holidays together. Myself and my boyfriend have been living together now for a while and I see a lot of his family and he sees a lot of mine. We have no plans for engagement or marriage just yet. 

I live in the city and his family mostly live about an hour and a half a way. One of his brothers live close. My brother lives in another country. 

I would love my family to meet his family. They don't often get together (there is seven in the family and they are all adults so it is hard) maybe four or five times a year, which is more then most. 

Because engagement and marriage isn't on the cards yet I was just wondering how could I possibly get them at something all together. I would just love them to all meet. My boyfriend is graduating from college in November but, my brother won't be around for that. 

I would just love to arrange something to have everyone together and meet everyone. It is important to me. Our apartment is too small to host anything and my boyfriends mother is on her own so I wouldn't like it to just be my parents and her. 

I don't know a natural way to get everyone together but, I would love for them all to meet each other at this stage as I am very close to his family and my family is very close to him. Is there a tactful way to do this? I am assuming sometime close to christmas? Or is this just kinda weird to want with out marriage and engagement on the cards?
