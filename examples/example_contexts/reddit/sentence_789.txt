TITLE: How to deal with games at the beginning of a relationship?
POST: Hello everybody,

I (f, 27) have met a very attractive guy (35) on an online dating-site and started to see him every now and then since the beginning of September. 

We are I believe what you would call a "casual relationship" that is making me insane. Somehow he behaves more rudely than anybody I ever met before (he drops me at the railway-station without even asking whether he should wait with me for the train, when we walk through a crowd he sometimes walks 10m in front of me without taking my hand, because at some point I said I prefer reducing PDAs, he purposefully ignores me). 

The options are: 1. he's not that interested in me. and
2. he's playing games

I do not believe that he's not interested, because he would have the possiblity of FWB with me and we have rather trouble filling our time with things we mutually enjoy (I like artsy movies and sports, he likes to smoke and drink). Sex is really good and I generally get good feedback from him. So it must be him playing games.

He would do things like not meeing me for two weeks, when definitely having the options (he has a car and would have to drive 45 minutes)
to do so, and during the period calling (for three days every day for an hour and then for four days nothing, and not responding to my calls and calling back much later). 

Since I questioned him about his mental sanity (twice) and he assured me that he believes to be sane, I assume he's playing games. What should I do? I like him and sex with him, I don't believe us to have a lot of potential for a serious long-term relationship, because he destroys his body with poinson. However, his games make me think about him constantly and make me want him. Am I the crazy one?
TL;DR:
