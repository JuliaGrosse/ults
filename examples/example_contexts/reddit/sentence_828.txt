TITLE: What software do you use to sift through music when deciding what to keep?
POST: Hey Reddit, so I've got tons of music that my friends erm, "bought" me... 
   
I want to listen to it all and decide what to keep (I'm running out of space and also hate having to continually hit "next" when I'm not feeling something)  
  
Here's the issue: I'm having a hard time devoting the time to paying close enough attention to what's playing to make a "yea or nay" decision on a per song or per album basis.  
  
Does anyone know of any media player that will prompt me to decide whether a song makes the cut or not after the song finishes?
TL;DR:
