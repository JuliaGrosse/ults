TITLE: How do I tell my girlfriend she's too boring?
POST: **CAVEAT - I'm going to sound like an arrogant douchebag. Let me preface this by stating that everything is said with the utmost of intended modesty. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for a bit over six months now, she's very attractive, very intelligent, and occasionally funny, other than this one problem, she'd be perfect. This problem was something that I ignored at my own peril at the start of the relationship, now it's biting me in the ass. 

Quite simply, my girlfriend is boring. During any kind of social engagement, she sits in the corner and doesn't talk to anybody except me. If she has something to say to somebody, she asks me to tell them. In private, she's demure to a fault, when she's not being indecisive she'll just agree with me. Whenever I ask her about why she's the way it is, she'll just tell me that she trusts me with whatever choice is being made, and I shouldn't worry about it, because it's impossible for her to get mad at me. 

At this point, I'm ready to call it quits on the relationship - but she doesn't feel the same way. She's been nothing but dedicated to me and my needs for all things, except a real personality on my part. How do I let her go without damaging her feelings too badly?
