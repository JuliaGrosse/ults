TITLE: Me [16M] with my Girlfriend [16F] 2 months, Acting really strange with me.
POST: Please try and disregard the ages on this situation. 

So this girl really likes me, and I really liked her so I asked her out and she said yes. Now it's been about 2 months now and she seems...bored. I always make her feel special by buying her gifts, complimenting her, telling her I love her and that sort of thing. 

Recently, I was skyping her and my buddy called me and asked me if I wanted to join him for a game that was about 15 minutes away. I told my girlfriend over skype that I would have to leave and she got a little bad and hung up the call. Of course, I called her back and told her that I'm sorry that it was kinda last second, and that I hope she wouldn't mind. She didnt say anything and just hung up. I just texted her again and apologized. She has a tendency to get mad over small things really easily so I thought it would just blow over before the next day.

Now she never smiles around me as much and she doesnt talk to me like we used to talk to each other. She just seems kinda bored now. I've tried talking to her about it and i've asked her if it was because of that night and she said it wasnt. But she's just been acting different around me. She's completely fine around her other friends. It's just with me.
TL;DR:
