SUBREDDIT: r/Advice
TITLE: FIXED: Reddit, I will do anything that is legal. How can I make $5,000 in the next 10 days? (x-post from /r/LPT /r/Assistance and /r/AskReddit)
POST: **If there is a better sub that I can x-post this on, please let me know.**

I am currently a financial burden on my family who has very little. 

I was recently in an accident that totaled my car. I bought a $900 dollar car (that was all I could afford) only to have it break down needing a new engine. I have about $400 dollars right now and I can get rides to my internship from my dad. I hate wasting his money for gas and I live at home eating my parent's food. 

$250 a month in loans are coming and I have a better paying job lined up that can get me out of this situation and I convinced them to give me 12 days before I start.
To be able to work there I'll need a reliable car and reliable computer. My parents' work schedule won't allow them to get me there on time.

**Skills**

I am a college graduate with a PR and Graphic Design degree. I have experience working in IT (why I love reddit) and I can teach swimming since I swam in college. I have a DLSR 5100 camera and photo/video skills. Will do any manual labor if that's what's needed. 

**I will work day and night. I will shovel poop. Whatever I can.** 

I don't think this is an unreasonable number, and if this produces any results I will post with the progress at the end of the 10 days. 

*Additionally, I am sure I am not alone in the post college struggles and any advice will help us all.
TL;DR:
