TITLE: I[29F] am having a difficult time being supportive to my husband of 1 year [35M] during this emotional time
POST: My husband and I have gone through 2 consecutive miscarriages in the last 4 months. It's been a very emotional time. The grief, despair, frustration, pain, and trauma have been incredibly taxing (on us both). Additionally, he and I both process our emotions in such completely different ways. I've been expressive and needy, while he is quiet and withdrawn. He feels like he has to be strong for us, especially when I'm breaking down. Sometimes I wish he could just stop that act and come be sad with me.

Yesterday, he shared with me that he feels so much pressure from the demands of his job, trying to get into school, providing for our family, and trying to be supportive of me during this time. I know he just needed to blow some steam but the way he said it felt like there may be some resentment towards me. I asked if that's what he meant. He said no, but I can't seem to shake this feeling.

I am finishing up my college degree and I am not contributing financially to our family at this time. It's the first time in my adult life that I've been dependent on someone else. As such, these feelings of being needy (both financially and emotionally) are very foreign to me. I guess I have some guilt about it. I'm doing my best to clean and help around the house, but I'm also very overwhelmed with school, infertility testing, processing emotions, etc. Seriously, I don't even get much sleep. I want to be able to help alleviate some of his pressure, but I don't know how when I already feel stretched so thin.

I am seeing a therapist and we are going to marriage counseling, but it'll be at least another week until we can get more appointments.

Any suggestions?
