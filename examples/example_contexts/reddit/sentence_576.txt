TITLE: I [18f] just got dumped by my [18m] boyfriend. Unsure of gift protocol.
POST: Recently my boyfriend of 3 months dumped me, pretty much out of the blue. Long story short, our relationship ended amicably despite our feelings about the relationship not being mutual (I wanted to make things work, but he wanted to just remain friends). We exchanged Christmas presents the same day we broke up. I got him a few things that matched up with his interests, and he gave me a nice bracelet. He made sure to emphasize that he bought this awhile back, presumably before he started drifting away from the relationship.

The pamphlet that came with the bracelet said that it was made of precious, authentic gemstones and is often given to another person as a declaration of "unconditional love". As I'm sure you can imagine, I cannot find it in my heart to keep this bracelet. Whenever I look at it, I am reminded of the love I felt (and still feel) for him, and I am also reminded that this bracelet was given to me under circumstances that no longer apply. It hurts. I'm pretty sure I'm never going to wear it for this very reason, so it'll go to waste as long as it's sitting here in my room. I want to mail it back to him.

I realize it's rude to return a gift, but I just don't think it'll be good for me to keep it. As it is, I'm implementing the "no contact" rule so I can have time to process and move on. I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I know that keeping it around will not only give me a false sense of hope, but will also deny him the chance to give the bracelet to someone truly special. I plan on sending the gift back with a letter explaining why I couldn't accept it, so hopefully he will understand why I had to do this. If possible, I'd like to do this in a way that will not harm our chances of remaining amiable acquaintances.
TL;DR:
