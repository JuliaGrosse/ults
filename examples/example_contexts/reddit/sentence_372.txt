SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [21 M] with my best friend [21F] of 6 years did i went too far?
POST: So we have a 6 year friendship relationship and we tell eachother pretty much everything, she knew that i had some feelings for her and wanted more than a friendship but she didn't.

Now on my birthday she sent me a letter writing about why we can't be more than friends.  Her birthday is up and i sent her a real heart-felt letter answering to her question "if we should remain friends if i have feelings for her".

Now this letter at the time I didn't thought it was intense but looking back to my best friend it might come as a shock and too powerful, I wrote about the times she broke my heart when she hooked up with friends of mine, but at the same time told her that it wasn't her fault.

Basically i wrote 8 pages about that and the frustration and how much i loved her and now she barely answers my texts, did i went too far by telling her what i really thought about our relationship?

Urgh i don't know what to do, kinda need help here guys and gals
TL;DR:
