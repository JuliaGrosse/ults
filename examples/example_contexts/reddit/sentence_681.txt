TITLE: Me [20 F] with date [23 M], went on a date, he hasn't texted me, I keep thinking about him
POST: Met a guy on an app, he goes to my university but is in the law school. We had an amazing amazing amazing date, where we sat for five hours just talking, he spent 70 dollars on drinks for us. I felt like we connected really well, and at the end of the date while he was walking me home he kissed me multiple times and it was great, then said we'd go out again in September when he's back from a 3 weeks trip to see family abroad. I texted him the next morning saying I had a great time, and he said he did too, and a joke about the next time we meet, I texted him back something funny, and no response, havent heard from him since and im assuming already away. What's the deal? Did he like me? Will he text me in September?
TL;DR:
