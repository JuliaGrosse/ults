TITLE: [19F] My boyfriend's [25M] mom is controlling
POST: Background: My boyfriend and I have known each other for a year and have been seeing each other for about 5 months. We recently made our relationship official. His dad died about 6 years ago, and as a result still lives with his mom to take care of her. We live an hour and a half away from each other so we can only see each other on the weekends. He usually comes to my place and stays for the whole weekend.

The problem is that his mom always wants him to be home with her. When he's with me she will constantly text him telling him that he needs to clean/do chores, give her rides, and even to come home. She questions him about where he is and why he's gone all weekend. When I asked him why she does this, he said that it's because she's alone in the house, but he is with her all during the week and his sister comes home from another city for the weekends. He isn't a mamma's boy and isn't over-attached to her, but he will sometimes leave my house early because his mom expects him to be home at a certain time. I feel frustrated because he is old enough that he doesn't need his mom to monitor and police him! I want to say something about it, but it isn't my place to get involved with him and his mom's relationship. I also feel somewhat selfish; his poor mom is a widow and I'm sure her wanting him to be home has to do with his dad's passing. I don't want to keep him from his mom at all, but I know this will become more of a problem as our relationship progresses, especially if we want to get serious.

How should I handle this? As I said I want to confront him about it before it becomes a bigger problem, but I can't help but feel it isn't my place and I'm not sure how to go about it.
TL;DR:
