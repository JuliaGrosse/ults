TITLE: I am currently in Flordia and want to see some sights on the way back to Canada. Any suggestions for places to stop on the way? (More info inside)
POST: We are currently in Melbourne, FL and would like to make our way back to Canada along the east coast. Final destination would be Toronto. I am looking at the following schedule;

* Sunday (tomorrow) - Leave Melbourne for Charleston, SC
* Monday - Leave for Richmond, VA
* Tuesday - Leave for Montreal, QC
* Wednesday - Party to support Canadiens in the finals
* Thursday - Return to Toronto

Does anyone have any suggestions for places to visit along the way, the cities I chose were mostly random. I'm trying to keep driving down to about 6-7 hours a day. I know the Richmond to Montreal run will be longer that's why I'm looking to stay there for two days.
TL;DR:
