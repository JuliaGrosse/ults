TITLE: My (18/F) parents (59/F & 60/M) are moving across the country and expect me to move with them. How to tell them I want to stay here?
POST: I've lived in New York my entire life, and I love it here. I live in a big city north of NYC and I love everything about it. I have good friends and a boyfriend I adore. My parents have recently decided to put our house up for sale and move over to Arizona, which I feel would be a drastic change for me, and every time they have talked to me about it, they say they "need" me in Arizona with them, and that I'm going to love it there.

I really don't want to move there. I have tried to have an open mind about it, but every possible outcome the cons outweigh the pros. It had been very difficult for me to make and keep friends, having a very tough high school experience and I've finally made some lasting bonds and to up and move would be the worst, especially with them all going to college. Plus I have my boyfriend, who I have an amazing connection with, he's even said I can move in with him (which I don't think I'd want to do because he lives in NJ and my parents would disapprove). 

I just graduated high school and am currently working this year part time, and planned to go to a local college next fall. My older siblings both live in NY and I have a strong connection with my sister, I couldn't bare being so far away from her. How can I make it work so that I don't have to move with them? Thing is, I don't know if I could afford my own place here (It's pretty expensive) and I'm not sure if I could live with my sister. 

Any advice on how to talk to them about it? My dad is very stern and insists he knows best for me, when he really has no clue/doesn't pay attention to my life. I'm scared of saying no to him and how he'll react. And while I'm technically an adult being 18, if I got cut off from them I'd have a very hard time getting by financially.
TL;DR:
