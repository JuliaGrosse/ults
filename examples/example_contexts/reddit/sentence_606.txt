TITLE: [Help] Grandmothers 6 Y/O shih tzu peeing everywhere
POST: Short backstory:
My grandparents live in a 2 story town home, but they trained their dog on potty pads in the house instead of training her outside, so she doesn't get out much and isn't very stripped from her routine. As of February, my grandfather passed and everyone is going through a rough time, and I think the dog is as well. My grandmother every night before bed went upstairs to sleep, but she can not bear sleeping in the bed without my grandfather so she has been sleeping downstairs on the couch ever since. My grandmother also leaves the house a lot more now than she used to, and we recently started packing up furniture to start moving her closer to us.

The problem:
The dog (Sadie) keeps peeing all over the floors and not on her potty pads that are in certain spots in the house (2 spots downstairs, 1 upstairs.) she often pees in front of the staircase, sometimes poops. Well now my grandmother is staying at our house for the weekend while she moves, and now the dog is peeing all over my kitchen floor. She scolds the dog whenever it happens, but nothing changes. My grandma is getting sick and tired of this, and doesn't want to get rid of the dog but she can't take it anymore. What steps do we need to take in order to fix the dogs potty problem? Is it a way of grieving? Is it out of spite for changing her routine?
TL;DR:
