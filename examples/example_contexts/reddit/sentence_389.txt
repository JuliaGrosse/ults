TITLE: My SO of 2 years (21 F) is traveling, she went to club and danced against a guy, but tells me (21 M) it's just having fun and got mad at me for being upset
POST: I just need some advice Relationships, am
I being overly jealous? Some quick backstory, my SO is volunteering for a program in another country. She's made great friends with the other volunteers, but most of the guides are older men and they actively try to seduce the girls. My SO has denied all advances, but two of them keep telling her they really like and care about her. Makes me uneasy to begin with. So last night she went to a bar with her friends and then a club, and danced with one of the two guides.  I love her dearly but the thought of her even dancing like that with someone else bothers me. If I try to bring it up she gets very defensive, but understands why I feel the way I do. Were both extremely close, have been best friends for 6 years, dating for two, we've lived together for a year. I know she would never do anything that's considered cheating or would hurt me or our relationship, I just feel very off about the whole situation.
TL;DR:
