TITLE: New dog owner here, feeling unliked by my dog.
POST: My wife and I just adopted a new dog about a week and a half ago.  She's a little over a year old, and she's a Yorkie-dachshund mix.  When we got her, she was glued to both of us all the time.  Followed us everywhere, cried when we weren't around, etc.  

Within the past few days or so I've noticed that she only does this with my wife now, and I have no idea why.  Nothing has changed in terms of what we do with her.  We both play with her, feed her, take her for walks, etc.  Sometimes we do these things together, sometimes individually.  I really couldn't say that one of us does any more than the other in these areas.

Here's an example.  We crate the dog when nobody is home, so we did this before the two of us went out today to get groceries.  When we came back home, our dog was very excited.  I opened her crate, but she blew right by me and ran up to my wife.  She didn't even acknowledge I was there.

I've been spending a lot more time with her in general because I'm a teacher and have been home with her more.  Might that have something to do with it?  Could she be getting bored with the person who is around more often, and gets more excited around my wife because she sees less of her?

This is my first dog.  My wife grew up with them, but even she's stumped as to why this is happening.  Our dog isn't mean towards me (growling, etc.), just seemingly apathetic unless I'm the one making an effort.  In other words, she'll play with me if I initiate it.  Otherwise, she kind of ignores me.

Any thoughts?
