TITLE: I [24M] have nothing in common with my SO [23F], I'm underestimated by her and she's not trying anymore.
POST: Hi, I'm a 24M with great job and lots of hobbies, I work a lot and I love it, hence I always have something to do. I'm also quite resourceful in everyday life. My SO is 23F, working and studying, has poor and badly paid job, no hobbies. We love each other, but we share no interests and we have diametrically different opinions about everything (religion, minorities, guns, food, literally everything).

We're living together for a few months now and it's been tough. She stopped trying, just requiring, complaining and constantly being depressed (because lack of her money, issues at work, at uni etc.). She also acts like she was thinking that I should commit all my free time to her.

Also I feel totaly underestimated becasue I'm always worst in her eyes and I'm even no respected for my job which gives me enough money to buy all common stuff (home expenses, groceries, fees, etc) except for rent which I share with her.

She, on the other hand, is 'feeling not loved' becasue I enjoy going out without her (~2 times a month with a friends for a beer) but with her I'd rather stay at home and talk/watch a movie/do other stuff. Still I'm going out with her at least few times a month because I know she likes it.
TL;DR:
