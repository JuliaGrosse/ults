TITLE: So I [18M] have been growing distant with my gf[21F] and I'm getting feelings for her cousin[16F].
POST: I know guys. This is a pretty fucked up situation.
I've been with my gf for about one year and things were going okay, but a few months ago I started losing interest because I'm feeling very unfulfilled with our communication and ambitions.
And I've been contemplating breaking up with her for those few months and I'm having trouble finding the right way to do it. But a month ago she brought me to a family gathering where I met her cousin and we immediately hit it off, same taste in music, books, movies, TV, art, ideals, philosophy and ambitions. And we've been talking online almost everyday since then.
I'm pretty sure she likes me and I know I like her a lot. And she knows that I've been going through stuff with my gf and she told me last night that she thinks that I talk to her too much when I should be talking to my gf to try to work things out and she doesn't want to be a contributing factor if I and my gf break up.
Which I totally understand but I'm just having trouble on what I should do now.
I'm not happy with my current relationship and I want to break up but she is very attached to me so I can't figure out a way to let her off softly and I know if I make her heartbroken then there is no way I can continue any sort of relationship with her cousin.
Part of me says I need to walk away from the whole thing. But I have a real connection with her cousin so I don't want to. Halp plz.
TL;DR:
