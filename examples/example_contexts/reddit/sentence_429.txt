TITLE: (Los Angeles) Not your typical automatic gate damage
POST: So the parking lot of our apartment has an automated, chain-driven sliding gate. Our car was parked in the spot parallel to and just behind the gate, along where the sliding gate backs up while being opened. We were getting in the car as another car was exiting the lot and triggered the automatic sensor to open the gate. Just as the gate was sliding next to our car, the breeze blew open our driver's door far enough open for the back of the opening gate to catch the inside of our door, pull it open further than it is supposed to, and slightly twist it before stopping. After 15 minutes of figuring out how to close the gate stuck against our door we inspected the damage. The door can barely close and lock, but since it's twisted the top half is open to rain and coat hangars while the bottom half is pushed in further than it should. 

Here's the question. Are we justified in asking the complex owner to fix the door? And if they so no, are we justified enough to take them to court over it and win?
TL;DR:
