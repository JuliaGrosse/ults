TITLE: Metabolism changes, gained weight while I was trying to lose some. HELP
POST: Hey guys!
Basically I've always had quite a fast metabolism, you know that type of person that eats healthy and goes to the gym one day and loses half a pound the other? Yeah, that was me. I was trying to lose weight, and got to losing about 20 pounds. I had about 6-7 pounds left to go, super motivated, and I then started taking a new contraceptive pill that totally changed my body functioning. I gained about 6 pounds, but my habits are still similar. I can no longer ''eat healthy and go to the gym'' on one day and immediately see results on the other. I feel like my metabolism has slowed down, and it's starting to get me anxious... It's been two months on this new pill, now I'm 12 pounds over goal, vegetarian and still determined to lose it.

Can you guys help me, give me tips/advice on how to boost my metabolism speed or how to fin more efective ways to lose it  ''quickly'' please? Thanks :)
