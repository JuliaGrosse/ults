TITLE: TIFU by being concerned
POST: This actually happened a few months back but whatever

Being a reasonably hygienic person, I tend to shower from time to time. So on this gloriously rainy and generally disgusting day in Ireland I decided to wash myself before heading to bed, my girlfriend decided she was going to clean our room a bit while I was in the shower which was great.

Fast forward to me being in the shower, soaping it up, having a real good time, when suddenly I hear the most ghastly and terrifying wail I have ever heard in my life. What the fuck is after happening? Images of the wardrobe after falling on my girlfriend flashing through my mind.  I immediately jump out of the shower and hurry to the bedroom (almost slipping) and barge into the room, face alight with worry & concern, boobs bouncing with urgency, shouting "ARE YOU OK? WHAT HAPPENED?". My girlfriend turns to me, utterly confused 

Gf : "What?"
Me: "I thought I heard you scream. Are you ok?"
Gf: "Yeah I'm fine, I was just singing."

Just singing.

We stand silent for a moment allowing what had just happened to soak in, maintaining eye contact. Soapy bubbles dripping from my hair down my body. Mutually embarrassed and equally amused we laugh it off and I return to the shower.
TL;DR:
