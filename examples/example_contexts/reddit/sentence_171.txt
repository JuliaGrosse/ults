TITLE: Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] together for 6 years, she no longer "wants" me
POST: Hello guys, first post here, I'm hoping for some advice.  
As stated I'm a 22 year old guy. I've been together with my girlfriend for 6 years and it was the first real relationship for both of us.. first kiss, first time sex etc.  
Everything was going fine. We fought, sorted it out multiple times and to me everything seemed fine. I still love her as much as I ever did before.

But a few weeks ago she started seeming absent. Didnt want to kiss or cuddle anymore unless i initiated it and did not want to have sex at all.  
I accepted it for a bit, but confronted her about it a week later. She told me that she noticed it too. However she didn't know why it was that way. She says she still loves me, but explained that it turned into a more family kind of love over time.

We talked everything over, there was a lot of crying, but no real fighting and we decided to just see what happens. I'm gonna leave her alone until she decides wether she wants to break up for good or not.

Is there still any hope for this relationship or should I start dealing with all this? Any tips on how to proceed are apprecciated.
TL;DR:
