TITLE: Me [30 M] with my GF [27 F] long-term live in, can't clean up after herself
POST: I live with my GF in a house that we share. We've been together for several years now and I can't really take it anymore. Anything related to stuff she doesn't finish. 

  

My GF has this attitude of "I'll do it later." She cooks and doesn't pick up the cooking detritus. She does her laundry and leaves her clothes on the laundry room floor/in the dryer. She spreads the contents of her purse on the kitchen table and never bothers to put it away. Every day when I come home from work I know the first thing I have to do is grab a broom/mop/rag and start cleaning and I am tired of it 

 

I am not the neatest person in the world, and I am not perfect. But I know if leave grease and food on the stove we'll get roaches. I know that if the toilet is clogged I should unclog it. Every time I talk to her about completing tasks and cleaning up after the tasks I get a non-committal response and a "I was planning on doing it." I'm tired of nagging her about it, and it is starting to negatively impact the relationship. What can I do,  how can I talk to her?
TL;DR:
