SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [25 M] and my GF [24 F] of 2 years just broke up because she fell for a guy that persuaded her to join his religion. Am I the only one who thinks that's stupid & immature of her?
POST: We were doing really well as we overcame some difficult obstacles and gone through some rough fights. But everything was going smoothly and we were still in love. 

Then, just overnight, she said she wanted to break up because she has been talking to a guy behind my back and she started developing feeling for him. If she wanted to join a religion and be closer to God then that's perfectly fine with me. But the fact that she joined for a guy makes me sick and confused.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Am I wrong for thinking that she is nuts or too immature to be in an adult relationship if she can just jump ship like that? I have a feeling that I'm better off without her.
TL;DR:
