TITLE: advice needed for on again/off again "friendship" between (18f) and myself (21m)
POST: Hey guys,

I will try not to be wordy here -- a friend (f 18) I met back in high school just entered her first semester at State and wants me to visit her.  Met her when I was 18, I'm now 21 and commute to a local university.  We have had an interesting on again/off again friendship mostly communicated through social media/texting/snapchat.  Hooked up once at a party at home this spring.  She and I always joke that we will talk pretty much daily and then kind of drift apart and come back and act like we've been friends all along.  I think I like her and I'm very much attracted to her.  Anyways, I text her after not talking for a while (few months) saying good luck with her first semester, etc.  She responds that she wants me to come visit, very friendly conversation, etc.  Ends with "text me sometime" This is where my dilemma is: my idea was to wait a few days, not give her immediate satisfaction but I do want to continue conversing with her.  My buddies are telling me to COMPLETELY ignore her and let her come to me, but she hasn't been known to do that in the past, especially with me being the older guy.  I understand that playing hard to get works, and I certainly don't want to be that older guy coming on too strongly.  What should I be doing? I'm an attractive dude and usually have no issues with putting myself out there to girls, but I've been out of the game for a while and wanted to get some advice.  How should I be communicating with her moving forward if I want to see where it can go? Don't have a relationship on the mind right now, maybe more a friends with benefits type situ.  Anyways, sorry for the rant! Any advice appreciated.
TL;DR:
