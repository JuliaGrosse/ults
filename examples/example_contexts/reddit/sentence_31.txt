TITLE: friend of friend [17 F] with a person she doesn't know well [23 M] met at a concert
POST: The friend (M) is concerned for her friend (V).  She said that they met at a concert and prettymuch immedietly started making out.  She doesn't know the guys last name, where he lives, etc. and wants to sleep with him.  I'd consider myself a pretty sex positive person, and if you wana do the do, then by all means.  However, I can't help find it strange that (despite being legal, 17 in new york) that she'd be getting involved with someone 6 years her senior while shes so young.  She doesn't have the best history with dating, and it seems destined to fail and potentially dangerous.  I know it's a fuckload of 'not my buisness', but, can't help but be a bit concerned as I did work with V and know her a bit. 

I guess normally I'd try and say that people need to learn from mistakes, but knowing she has a history of sexual abuse and mental health issues, and the fact that it may just be flatout dangerous to her health/well being I can't help but be a bit concerned

Being a 23 year old guy, I can say that yes, V is cute, but holyshit would it feel weird as a 23 year old to be with someone so young/immature and feel kind of concerned for the guy's character.
TL;DR:
