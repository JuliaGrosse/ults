TITLE: Addicts can't be friends
POST: Originally posted in /r/relationships.  I was told that I should have put it here. Sorry guys.

I (female, 24) was living with a friend(female, 37) who is an addict, for 3 years. I'm also an addict. But I have my code of conduct which includes not stealing from injured, mentally ill, or old people. She has no such code.

Yesterday, I found out she stole pills from an elderly guy in our building with heart problems. After he saw the pills missing, she immediately said she saw me leaving his apartment. I haven't set foot in there except to fix his tv. 

After telling everyone that I stole the pills, she kicked me out and didn't give me enough time to pack. My name isn't on the lease so I'm assuming this is legal for her.

But now I'm homeless, broke because she stole all my money, and haven't eaten since before noon yesterday. 

I need advice on what to do. I hate losing friends because of drugs. That's why I have my code. But I still love that crazy chick like a sister.

First time posting content and I'm on my phone so sorry for any errors. Also let me know if I posted in the wrong sub.
TL;DR:
