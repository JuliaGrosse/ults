TITLE: Me [27 M] with a good friend [26 M] of 10 years - Invited him to a sailing trip, don't want him to come anymore
POST: So my girlfriend, two friends of us and me wanted to go on a sailing trip in a few weeks and rent a boat. At first we were not enough people to pay for the vacation (renting a boat, house etc.) so I asked a few friends if anyone wanted to come.

One of them actually agreed to come with us, even though he knows only me there. Now that two other friends of my girlfriend tag along, I think he wouldn't really fit in that group. I have a feeling he might even make me uncomfortable in a few situations. I'm not sure if I still want him to come with us, but don't know how to get out of this while still keeping him as a friend (I like him, but as I said, I just don't think he would fit in). If I just tell him, we don't go on that trip, he will eventually find out (Facebook photos etc.)...

I appreciate any contribution/suggestion/discussion.
TL;DR:
