TITLE: Me [18 M] with my BestFriend [18/F], Sudden loss of feelings, PLEASE HELP
POST: Basically, I met her this year and we became the best of friends within 7 months. I met her as we were in the same class during the semester and I had a crush on her. Told her after 1 month and found out she was in a relationship. Tried to forget and get over her but couldn't. Few months later, she broke up, and 2 months ago, I told her I still liked her and would want to chase her. Then fast forward, we started holding hands and giving hugs frequently and she told me that she has feelings for me but now is not the time to be in a relationship, so we are withholding it.

But suddenly, I feel a loss of feelings for her last Saturday. I felt very sad and depressed. I'm not sure what I am or where I am now. If I was infatuated with her, or that my feelings became from intense to dull as we started doing more things.  I told her yesterday. I requested to stop holding hands and hugging. I think I still love her, but maybe not the same as before where it was thrilling. I'm not sure about myself now. I care very very much about her and really do not want to hurt her. I'm lost please help. I'm feeling very heartbroken about myself now and her
TL;DR:
