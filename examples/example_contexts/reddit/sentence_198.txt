TITLE: Me [19/F] with my mum [39/F], the light bill's in my name but I want to move out. How do I go about that without her freaking out?
POST: So, my mum is kinda bad with money. Like, really, REALLY bad with money. She is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt thanks to an old house she bought and then stopped paying for completely, and she owes pretty much every company you could possibly think of more money than I can fathom. 

We moved out of our house a year ago and into a tiny apartment when the house finally got repossessed. Since my mum owed the electric company several hundred dollars, she convinced me to put the bill in my name, even though I had no job at the time. She said it would help me build credit and that she'd make sure it got paid on time, so, being just barely 18 and stupid, I believed her. 

Recently, things have gotten pretty bad at our house, with her letting my older brother move in and live for free and pretty much trash the place, and since I have a job now I was considering trying to get my own place. There's also the matter of her starting to get behind on payments, no matter how much I give her from my paychecks, so I'm worried about her racking up debt on me. I just was wondering, what should I do about the lights? And how would I bring it up to her? She gets a bit vicious at even the slightest mention of me being independent (she flipped when she heard I would start paying for my dogs' food) so I was wondering what the best way to broach the subject would be, if at all?
