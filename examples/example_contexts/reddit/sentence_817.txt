TITLE: My [M, 21] girlfriends [F, 22] farts are the worst I have ever smelled and she doesn't seem to bother.
POST: Hi everyone,

so this is a bit embarrassing. We started dating almost two years ago.

I want to say, I'm used to pretty bad farts. I have lived for three years with a roomie who had lactose intolerance and couldn't give a fuck about it. But her farts smell *worse*. Like, a lot. 

At first I thought she had eaten something wrong and I was a little too embarrassed to address it, but her farts continued to smell like a dumpster on fire. So after a week or two I told her that I couldn't bear her farts, that I am concerned that she might be sick, that she should see a doc and that she should leave the room when she feels that she has to fart.

Her reaction was... a little demeaning, to be honest. She made it pretty clear that she doesn't see a problem with it and that I should leave the room if I have a problem with her farts.

As stupid as it sounds, I thought about breaking up with her because I just can't stomage her farts and I am not willing to seek refuge in the bathroom every ~30 minutes because she ripped one.

So, has anyone of you some advice?
TL;DR:
