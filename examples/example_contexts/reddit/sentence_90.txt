SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I'm [23 M] with my gf [19F] 1 year, I find it very hard to open up emotionally, and it hurts her.
POST: I'm an extremely logical person, and I'm passionate about certain particular things: language, philosophy and literature. So much so to the point where I'm borderline neurotic (if I don't understand something fully, or if it interests me greatly, I will often not stop until I've achieved whatever I've wanted to achieve. Here's an example: I'm studying French, but I got frustrated at not understanding all the grammar, so I spent 3 days, 10 hours minimum each day, studying the entire grammar book.

I'm in a long distance relationship and we talk regularly. She admitted yesterday that she doesn't feel warmth from me, I come across as quite cold to her, as I (unintentionally) direct the majority of our conversations towards my interests. Admittedly, she is more interested in me than I her, but that doesn't mean we don't feel the same way for each other.

I don't have a high emotional intelligence. I'm good in social interactions, but romantically, I almost explicitly express my feelings through love, or humour.

I really want to improve my emotional intelligence, but I don't know how. I want to make her feel appreciated. I would like to talk about how I feel and not just ideas, but the words don't come. To be blunt, with regards to these aspects, I'm emotionally retarded.
