SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My [28/F] GF is "overwhelmed". I'm a [24/M]. Please help me figure this out.
POST: Ok, here goes. Went on a backpacking trip with my GF and her family, been looking forward to it, took time off work to do it. I just got back from a 3 week work trip and a couple days later we go on this backpacking trip. Things go pretty shitty, it rains on us/hailstorms, her friend's dog shits in our tent, just overall no buenos. We get back, silent car ride home, her family stays and I go to my aunt/uncles so they have more room. 

She tells me that night that we need to talk. I go over today and she tells me that she's unhappy, feels overwhelmed, she says she doesn't know how to tell me whats on her mind and that she might not have been ready for a relationship. 

This is almost a year into the relationship, she's never brought any issues up to me (which was a big red flag I guess), and now all the sudden out of the blue things aren't working out, but she can't explain it to me clearly. What should I do? She seems like she has given up but still is open to talking.
TL;DR:
