TITLE: Me [25M] with my girlfriend [25F] of 1 year. Expensive gifts.
POST: About her: 25 years, female, have a child.

About me: 25 years, male, good salary, I'm fine with child and we have more than friendly relationships with him.

About us: 1 year together, not engaged or living together as of now, but things getting pretty serious out here and I know she feels the same way.

For the entire year everytime I suggest to help her with financial problems she refused it. She always tell me not buy anything expensive to her, and I didnt, because I'm really afraid that she might think that I'm trying to "buy" her or she will feel obligated to me in some way.

I hear from her A LOT that she really want to go to a trip to Turkey with her kid (Doc's also told her that it'll be good for her son because of recent allergy). She were saving money for about half a year. We purchased the tickets (she payed her first 20% of the price), but some problems poped up and she had to spend rest of this money. She was really devastated and want to drop the idea.

So, I've decided, what the hell, It's 8th of March this weekends. I really want to go with her and her kid and I can pay for damn tickets. And this leads me to couple of questions.

1. Trip cost 1k EUR for her and her kid. It's more than okay for me and she knows it. But will she accept this kind of gift from me?

2. Since she still have all the documents I can't really buy like new tickets. This leaves me with only option and it's to gift cash money for her. But I'm having troubles imagining how can I wrap it up so it wouldn't look like a piece of envelope?

Thank you.
