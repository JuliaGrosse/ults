SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [25F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 2 and a half years. Our parents (mine in their mid 40's, his in their mid 50's) haven't met yet, and we're not sure if we should facilitate that or let it happen naturally. What do you guys think?
POST: So, my boyfriend and I have dated for 2 1/2 years. I've met his parents, and he's met mine. We pretty much always lived about 15 minutes away from his parents, so we see him a lot. About a few months ago, my parents moved into the same city, about an hour away. We've brought up having them meet, but we're wondering if that's something you're supposed to facilitate, or if it's less awkward just to let it happen naturally.

We're both in our first "serious" relationship, so we both never had to have parents meet before. They'll probably like each other. They're all nice people, I think. Just don't know if it's more awkward to make it happen or let it happen. They've both expressed an interest in meeting the other before, but since my parents are an hour away, it's not likely that this can happen naturally. So, I'm not really sure if it's best to just wait and let it happen, or what. I guess I am a bit curious, but I don't want to make anything awkward or anything. What do you guys think?
TL;DR:
