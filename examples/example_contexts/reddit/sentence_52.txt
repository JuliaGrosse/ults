SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me 21 M with my girlfriend [21 F] of 3 years, and i broke up because i subconciously wanted something new.
POST: Names: Jessica (Ex); Michelle (Current GF)

I was with Jessica for over 3 years and i broke up with her because i started feeling like the relationship was gradually falling. I became friends with Michelle that was alot of fun and i enjoyed being with and going out with and ended up asking her out after a drunken night as payback because i was angry at Jessica. Slowly she started sleeping over and then gradually moved in by herself without me telling her to move in. Its gotten to the point that i really do not wanna be with her and i want to get back with Jessica. she knows this and wants to get back with me as well but i cant kick this girl out of my house. i try over and over and she ends up coming back in because im too "soft" i guess you can say. I miss Jessica so much and i really want HER to be with me. Its been about 6 months that i've been with Michelle and i want it to end for good but i really do not want to hurt her cause she ends up crying and i give in... what can i do? One and for all.
TL;DR:
