TITLE: Reddit: Do you check for photo Id's on credit card purchases? If so, have people ever gotten upset because of it?
POST: Today, I checked out a guy and he payed with his credit card. I then proceeded to ask for his ID in which he said "My signature is on the back of the card and when I sign it will look exactly like it." I thought to myself "Anyone can look at a signature and replicate it on a electronic signature machine." so I proceeded to tell him that I would prefer an actual photo ID. He then stumped me with "Visa has a merchant agreement in which if the back of my card is signed then I don't have to show you my ID." Touche sir. Just proceeded with the purchase and he was on his way.  But seriously, you'd think that people would be happy that you're at least checking IDs on credit cards to catch potential stolen cards. Whats your story?
TL;DR:
