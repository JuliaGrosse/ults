SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [26 M] with my 28 [F] of 2 years, am getting sick and tired of job stress being used an excuse. She just sent me a message that could be the last straw.
POST: My GF of the past couple years started a new job about 6 months ago. She finds it extremely stressful and hates it with every bone in her body. I totally understand - the demands are intense. She is putting in at least 60 hours and week and constantly dealing with last minute requests and insane expectations from her boss.

Unfortunately her stress has been overflowing into our relationship. I am often put on the sideline, which is totally okay. However, lately job stress is being used as an excuse to justify behaviour which I find completely unacceptable - verbal abuse, yelling, etc. I have done everything I can to try to be a supportive partner but my patience is wearing thin. 

Tonight I called her to say goodnight. She told me that she was super stressed, proceeded to hang up on me and then texted me that she "thinks we need to take some time". I replied that I have no idea what is going on and would like to talk. I called and she is simply ignoring me. I am fed up. 

How should I deal with this?
TL;DR:
