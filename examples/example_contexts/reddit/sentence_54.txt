TITLE: Girl said yes to lunch date, but I don't think she has an actual interest?
POST: Me, whom is a 20 year old male figured I would take the shot of asking out my crush (18F) in a snapchat conversation. It went in the lines of this

"We have a lunchdate when I get home, just so you know"

- "Haha ðŸ˜Š" (embarassed smiling emoji)

"I take that as a yes?"

"- Absolutely â˜º"

"Date it is then"

Whereas she stopped replying and I haven't had any reason to pursue any other conversation with her, just some minor that she kills by ceasing to reply despite the ends being loose to continue with if there was the desire to talk more. So I am confused, does she have an interest or am I wasting my time being toyed with despite her not being that type of girl? I am abroad now and discussing the specific lunchdate would across as weird momentarily but of course I will within a short future.
TL;DR:
