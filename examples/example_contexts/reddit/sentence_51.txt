TITLE: Didn't do too well over Christmas break.
POST: Basic Info:  M 19/6'0/233 lbs (105 kg).

So around the middle of November I decided that I need to make a change in my lifestyle before my weight gets to out of hand.  I started counting calories, running with the C25k program, doing pushups, sit-ups, and other exercises.  I had been doing very well and had lost over 10 lbs going in to Christmas break.

Then I go to my grandmom's house to celebrate the holidays and of course my grandmom being amazing like she is cooks really good food.  At first I promised myself that I was only going to cheat on Christmas day and I did that during the first half of the week.  After Christmas I pretty much crumbled, eating an entire large popcorn with butter all by myself when we went to the movies, eating way more than I needed too, didn't run or do any exercise for that matter, etc.

I get back home and was scared to get back on the scale to see how much of my lost weight I had put back on.  I was expecting to have gained 3-4 pounds back, but it turned out that I had gained 7 lbs back.  I felt awful.  That was over half of the weight that I had worked so hard to lose.

So now I am posting here hoping to get back on track or something.  I don't know maybe I am just ranting right now because I am fairly upset.  I don't know if any of you have gone through something similar to this, but if you have I would appreciate any info or experiences you have.
TL;DR:
