TITLE: Why does my [27 M] boyfriend want to come with me [25 F] to my Job?
POST: Whenever he is available and not working or going to school, he likes to come with me to work. Now this makes me uncomfortable because it would be all gravy if he came and went and did his own thing but that's not what happens. He comes, sits in the office and wants to grab my butt or kiss me (cool but what if we get caught? There are always people in and out of the office. I'm a lil uptight like that).

If I don't pay him any mind and DO MY WORK, he gets upset that I am ignoring him then he storms out of the office. Like clock work. I honestly wouldn't mind it if he didn't need constant attention, which he does.

I know it hurts him when he asks if he can come with me and I come up with some vague excuse as to why he can't, but how do I tell him without hurting him that I'd like to keep my work and relationship separate (I have already tried those exact words) but it always turns into a big argument... Oh he likes to argue alot!!!! sighs
TL;DR:
