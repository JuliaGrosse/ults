TITLE: [16F] with my boyfriend [16M] of 3 months, I'm having issues accepting something about him
POST: Before dating him I knew he wasn't a gold-star citizen, and I know about his issues. His father, up until 3 or 4 months ago, would physically abuse him, and I know a lot of verbal abuse goes on as well.   
---

For awhile (since 7th grade or so) he would resort to drugs and alcohol, and when I met him in 10th grade he'd sometimes show up to school high, or even a couple times having done shots in the morning. So I knew going in about a lot of this. But these things affected him directly, and then only casted affected onto other people in a more indirect way.   

Since we started dating he's stopped drinking and stopped with the drugs almost completely. He hasn't gotten high in weeks.    

However,  he's told me something about his past that I'm having trouble wrapping my mind around. He did something completely terrible that affected others in a direct way. He feels a large amount of remorse, and when he told me he was crying in the way that screamed regret. 

I don't know what to do, I care about him a lot, but this has taken away any romantic attraction. I was thinking about taking a break, but do those even work? I don't even know what that entails. Our relationship, up to this point, is short, only being together for 3 months but he's also a close friend of mine and I can't just walk away either. (I know there is 'other fish in the sea' but I can't just dump him because things get difficult. But how can I restore an attraction that was just ripped out?)
TL;DR:
