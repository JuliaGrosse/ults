TITLE: My [28/F] father [58/M] refuses to come to my wedding or allow my half siblings [16/F & 14/M] to attend unless I invite his new wife [42/F] who has always been horrible to me and rude to my mother.
POST: Subject pretty much says it all. 

I don't want to invite my father's second wife to our small wedding, he won't allow my siblings to attend or to come himself unless I invite her. 

My stepmother has made it clear from day 1 that she resents my existence and has never been nice to me and has always referred to me as 'the product of the mistake marriage'. My father has always treated his kids from their marriage better than me, but he's still my father and they are still my siblings. He is no walking me down the aisle, thankfully I have an easy out as in my fiancee's culture, it is customary for the bride/groom to walk down the aisle together to symbolise they are making the decision/entering this chapter of their lives together. 

Part of the reason I don't want to invite her is because I can't trust her not to say something horrible to my mother and completely ruin the day for her. The wedding is not really big enough to keep them separated and it will be hella awkward for my poor mother to have the woman my father cheated on her with hanging around all day.  My stepmother has made one too many snide comments to my mother out of earshot of my father for me to be comfortable inviting her.....and of course, since she is smart enough to do them out of earshot, my father thinks we are making it up. 

At the end of the day, my father is family, my siblings are family....she isn't. I feel like my mother's feelings need to matter more than my stepmohers. 

Anyway, I don't know what to do?
TL;DR:
