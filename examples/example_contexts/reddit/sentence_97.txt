TITLE: My Dad [59M] married a woman [52F] who is driving our family apart.
POST: I'll [25M] try to keep this short but concise. My dad has been married to this woman for over 8 years. She has serious mental issues (not professionally diagnosed) and has been driving a wedge between him and the rest of our family ever since. She consistently causes drama between herself and family members and my dad refuses to see it. He is very dependent in his relationships and is scared to be alone. She starts fights between his family and friends and manipulates him into always taking her side. He's lost all of his friends and is disconnected from a lot of family members because of her. 

I'm not sure if he doesn't see anything wrong with the things she does or says, or is so scared of being alone that he won't admit it. I think there's a chance he isn't happy but won't leave her for fear of being alone and/or because of the financial implications of a divorce. 

It's to the point where his immediate family is done putting up with her for his sake. We want to confront him and tell him this woman is a poison his life, but I am not optimistic any good will come of it. He's so scared of being alone that I believe he wouldn't divorce her no matter what and would end up losing the rest of his family to stay with her.
TL;DR:
