TITLE: So, my wife left me for another man (men) and left me with a pile of debt and 2 kids... What can I do?
POST: A little back story...
We have been married for 9 years and have 2 (wonderful) kids together.  Over the last 2 years, life became more difficult between us after throwing 2 kids into the mix.  I long suspected that she was cheating on me after our son was born 2 years ago, but one day we were on the way back from a trip to her parents place when she told me that she was leaving me and that she wanted a divorce.  Being shocked at this sudden revelation, I tried everything to get back together with her for my sanity and the kids' sake, but to not avail.  She moved in right away with another guy, so I know it must have been brewing for a while, but she left me to deal with a mortgage, tons of credit card debt accrued during her many stints without employment and shopaholic rage spending, 2 kids and all their needs thrown in and now lawyer fees.  I just got a notice that they are going to garnish my wages for a hospital bill that she got and never paid since I am the only person with a job right now. It also turns out that she was fired recently for "lewd activity" with one of her boyfriends while she was on the job.  Is there anything I can do?  My life is turned upside-down and as I am trying to get back on my feet for my kids, I get blindsided by her craziness and lack of responsibility.  Have any of you gone through this sort of mess?  Any tips you can give me would be greatly appreciated.  I know how amazing the reddit community is with giving advice to those in need, so, please...  How can I get my life back in order.
