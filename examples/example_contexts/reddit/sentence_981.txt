TITLE: [Help] Please help me understand why my dog is acting this way!
POST: I live in India where its common to see stray dogs and 9 months ago I found my dog Milo. She was only a puppy, barely 2 weeks old when i found her outside of my local supermarket. No one even looked at her but you could tell she was starved and looking for someone to love her. Me and my sister took her home. We showered and fed her and for the first week she was completely distant. But she slowly started opening up and eventually became a part of the family. My mom is the main caretaker now as I got busy with college and my sister went back to America. We are planning on sending Milo to America too in August so we made all preparations, including getting her spayed. This is where the problem started. The surgery went fine with no complications, however they did not have a cone to stop her from reaching the sticthes. We tried to use a muzzle but she could still get to them and she removed the stitches 2 times. After the second time we decided to make our own cone out of cardboard and it worked perfectly. She was a little out of it when we put on the cone but she quickly adjusted by the next day. After about 20 days the wound was starting to close and we decided to give her a bath. We took the cone off and she didn't seem different. HOWEVER once we put the cone back on she started acting more aggressive. She would start biting at my mom, me and the furniture. Up until now she had never shown any signs of aggression. My mom finally got fed up and started to tie her up every time she acted like this. I thought it was a little to far but it seems to work as she just barks for a little bit then goes back to chewing her towel and bed. Could anyone please help me understand why my dog is acting this way?  I've been completely flustered and frustrated these last week and don't know what to do.
