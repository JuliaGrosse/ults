TITLE: [Update] I am m32 in the UK trying to save my marriage.
POST: [Original post] ( So here's the update. After one short counseling session, therapist was late, and multiple conversations There may be hope for my marriage.

The big thing is She says she still loves me as a friend, but not as a husband right now. This is due to unkept promises about relocating to the UK. Of which I reminded her the only thing that kept me from resigning from my job in the US was her request. I realize most of you advise me against doing this. 

She likes to refer to a lot of things as I'm not to let you, meaning me, "Destroy this". To which I've had to also come back and say that this was a 2 Way St., I'm not feeling one who screwed up so I need help fixing it from you. 

Today she told me that she bought a house, got the down payment from my in-laws, as long as I was kept off the title of the house. Which I said that's completely bullshit. If anything they should be encouraging us to stay united not encouraging us to be divided. Which got me back to the point of I had a good thing going there before I was called away to do my United States work to which she didn't want me to resign from.  That she was criminalizing me (for lack of a better term) For doing what she asked me to do. 

When I got here I found out that she spoke to divorce lawyer, and I managed to through open communication back her from that ledge. And she is giving me three months to get my "shit together".  I.e. find a job and settle in the UK, which I'm very much actively pursuing.

 But my real question is from a group of strangers who know nothing more than the ramblings of this hopeless person what are the chances that I'm able to save my marriage?
