SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [21M] is stuck in a love triangle with two of my best friends.
POST: I'm sorry if I screw up formatting or anything because this is my second post in reddit ever.

So my two best friends are Bear[M] and Jet[F]. We all live in the same university. Bear and I have been really good friends for three years now. We became friends with Jet three months back. I developed feelings for her a while back. I tend to be stupid and go all in usually when i like someone. I've been trying really hard to be logical about this and i asked her out politely making sure that she could say no and not affect the relationship between both of us.

So a lot of people like the way Bear looks and a lot of my female friends occasionally flirt with him. Jet used to do the same too but yesterday she admitted to me about having feelings for him. What i want to do is not still have feeling for her and react to how i would to this if i didnt have feelings for her. Jet and i spend most of each day with each other. She's been a really good friend.

I dont know if Bear knows whats happening. I think he does. I havent told any of my friends about how i feel about this. The last time i did tell them when i had a crush on someone, they kinda made it harder for me to get over it and it got really difficult for me. He knows Jet likes him. But i dont think he feels anything. I dont want that to give me hope. I can't stop it either.

I don't know what to do. I have enough to deal with already with all of my academics going to shit because of my degrading mental health over the last couple of years. I'm just finally figuring out how to deal with depression and i think its working finally. I can't get outside of my own head and think this through. Can someone just talk to me about this,please?
TL;DR:
