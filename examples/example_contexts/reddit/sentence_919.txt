TITLE: Me [21M] with my girlfriend [20F] of 6 months, should I tell her about my insecurities?
POST: To give a little bit of background, about a year before I met my current SO, I got out of a very toxic, unhealthy 2 year relationship. Without going into too much detail, it involved constant manipulation and emotional abuse from my partner, and left me with a very low self-esteem and sense of self worth by the end of it. I had some counselling, and waited a year before I felt ready to date again.

Seven months ago, I met my current girlfriend, and we've been together for the past 6 months. It's been going amazing, I love her, and she hasn't given me any reason to believe that she doesn't feel the same about me.

Recently though, and despite all this, I've begun feeling insecure about my relationship. I know, logically, that I have no reason to, and that my GF has done absolutely nothing to make me feel this way. But still, everytime we have a rushed goodbye, everytime she has a reason for not being able to see me (which, by the way, are few and far between, and are always good reasons), part of me feels afraid. I'm afraid that she's only tolerating me, I'm afraid that I'm not good enough, afraid that she's losing those feelings she has for me. And no matter how much I tell myself this isn't true, I still feel those doubts in the back of my mind. And I know that if I continue to feel this way, I'll end up sabotaging the relationship myself somehow.

Now, she knows about my ex, but not the extent to which I feel that relationship messed me up. She's also been a victim of abuse in the past, so I'm sure she would understand, but I'm not sure if I should tell her these things, or if I should work through it myself.
TL;DR:
