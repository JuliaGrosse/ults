TITLE: I've lost the love of my life.
POST: Truth is, that I'm not coping at all. He ended it, just short of being together a year, completely out of the blue for me, and it has crushed me ever since. I haven't eaten for 4 days, and I just don't care for my life anymore. In a matter of days I have gone from a bubbly girl [19], doing everything she could to succeed at uni, to a wreck, who can't even bring herself to look in the mirror.

 Without him [19], I feel like nothing. After my restless nights, I always wake up to the dread and realisation that it is all over. I want him back but I don't know how, and I just don't understand why this all happened. 2 weeks ago we would have just finished having our most passionate sex for a long time.
TL;DR:
