TITLE: Problems with phone usage between boyfriend [21/M] of a year and me [21/F].
POST: I've been with my boyfriend for about a year now, and we see each other about once a week with lots of texting in between. 

Texting is my least preferred method of conversation, but its the fastest and most consistent method we have of communication. I really like talking on the phone, but he can't stand it and tries to avoid making any phone calls he can. He is a great guy who answers my calls the few times I've made them.

About a month ago, I brought all this up with him and asked if it were possible to have a ten minute phone call with him every now and then to replace some texting we do. He wasn't really on board but decided to try it. We had one extremely tense five minute conversation where he admitted it was only to please me, and then hung up. I felt like crap and haven't asked him for another phone call again. He hasn't called since, but continued like it never happened

I want to keep this relationship, but some days texts aren't giving me the connection I need with him. Asking him to call me just makes me feel like the most horrible girlfriend ever and ends with a tense, uncomfortable conversation anyway. Is there any middle ground or should I just cope with the texts?
TL;DR:
