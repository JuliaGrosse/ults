TITLE: TIFU by getting drunk in a third world country bar with my father in law
POST: This actually happened a few months ago.. So my father in law invited me to a local bar in a small town in Nicaragua.  My FIL is a heavy drinker and he's known to get very drunk to the point he passes out.  There's no talking him out of it.  So we go in and start drinking. I tend to go out with little money in case I get robbed. So an hour in to drinking,  my father in law is piss drunk.  I'm getting drunk,  but staying conscious enough to know what's going on.  I told him I'm out of money and we should go.  He tells me he has money and to order more drinks. At this point,  I stop drinking to try to sober up a little and he keeps going.  Eventually he passes out.  So I'm ready to go,  wake him up and tell him to pay the tab.  He reaches in his pocket and apparently he left his money at home.  The bar owner replies "in that case,  we keep the old man until you come back with the money."  So I leave the bar,  a drunk American late at night in a third world country walking home drawing the attention of every robber in a mile radius.  I got lost walking back and ended up at the opposite side of the town and what do you know,  I get robbed.  Luckily I had no cash on me,  but he did take my shoes. So now,  no shoes,  confused and lost I eventually run into someone that knew my wife's family and drove me home. I picked up some money,  put shoes on and went back to the bar with the ride.  My father in law was sleeping at one of the tables not having a clue of what I just went through.
