TITLE: Me [29F] with my cousin [29M] for 29 years, family and friends have serious problems with his fiancé
POST: My cousin has been with his gf (now fiancé) for about 6 years.  Our group of friends and my family think that she acts childish, rude, entitled and sometimes confrontational. Oddly enough, he is incredibly level-headed, calm and abnormally intelligent.  We believe he isn't oblivious to some of her behavior but lets it go on without formally addressing it with her. We have held our tongues for years to avoid an uncomfortable situation, but some of us are hitting a breaking point. What is the best way to handle this? I should also mention that my cousin and I have been very close since we were kids and live in the same area, so this is someone I see frequently. Socially distancing myself is an option but the idea of that makes me sad and I think its worse in the long run. Has anyone dealt with this before?
TL;DR:
