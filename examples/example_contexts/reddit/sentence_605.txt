TITLE: I've moved on - why does this hurt so much? (X-Post, r/Relationships)
POST: Hi, guys. I'll try to keep this brief, but give all the backstory I need to make myself clear.

At the beginning of December, I [19 f] broke up with my first long term boyfriend [18 m]. First kiss, first lover, first everything. We dated for almost two years. It was a very toxic relationship, he was selfish and sexist, very immature and very dominant, but I never realized it because I had never experienced anything else. Even sex with him was never anything special. We never "made love." We just had sex.

In February, I met the most wonderful guy on earth. He is everything my first boyfriend wasn't, and I am head over heels madly in love with him. Every time we make love, it is passionate and loving and perfect.

My ex-boyfriend, all the while, still showed signs of not moving on, and swore up and down that he would never find anyone else for him, nor would ever want to.

Today, however, I found out that my ex-boyfriend has been casually hooking up all summer with a girl we both know, whom he will be attending college with, both as freshmen. I also found out that he blocked me from Facebook, and unfollowed me on other social networking websites, seemingly unprompted.

I thought I had moved on. I have no complaints about my relationship - heck - or even my life. But why does this hurt so much? Is it wrong to wish, even just a little bit, that he still hadn't moved on? I guess I just miss feeling wanted. Even from someone who treated me so awfully.

Any words of advice, or similar stories?
TL;DR:
