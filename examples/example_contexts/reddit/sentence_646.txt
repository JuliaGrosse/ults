SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me(21m) and one of my closest friends (21f) have become interested in each other. She's not single
POST: So I've always been absolutely disgusted by the concept of cheating. But recently this girl who I've been friends with since 3rd grade told me she's regretted not being in a relationship with me while we were both in high school. I like her, she likes me.

She's also in a long term relationship, with a guy I know fairly well.
Should I just tell her I won't get emotionally invested until she decides what she's going to do about her bf? It's not fair to her, and especially not to him to act like we are.

If we dated it would be 2 hours long distance, not much is going to change that. I'm just looking for an outlet to talk to people about this.
TL;DR:
