TITLE: 36F Is it irresponsible to get married when you don't know if you want kids?
POST: I've never known for sure one way or another if I wanted kids. I've never really fantasized about it but I also have an appreciation for how amazing it can be to be a parent. I'm a well adjusted person, have good relationships and I want to get married. But since kids are the number one 'talk about this before you get married' question, it feels like I would be irresponsible to commit before I knew what i wanted in this department. 

Anyone have any advice on coming to a decision or working through it in a marriage?
TL;DR:
