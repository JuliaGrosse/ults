TITLE: HELP! Toddler [3yo] not sleeping through the night.
POST: This has been going on for about the past two weeks. I've tried everything and I'm coming up extremely short. 

My wife and I both work full time and we need to sleep at night. I'm in the military and regularly work anywhere between 10-15 hours a day and I end up getting about 5 hours of sleep a night, so when I sleep I sleep like a rock. My wife ends up waking to assist him, and she isn't used to the lack of sleep so she ends up more sleep deprived.

Ok, well here's the issue. My 3yo son has been waking up around the same time for at least a year, 9am. He normally naps at about 1pm for 2 hours and then we put him to bed at 9-10pm after everything is said and done. 

Lately he's been treating his bedtime as a nap, wakes up several hours in and continues to stay up all night. He'll then proceed to leave his room and trash the entire house. He knows how to open the child proof cabinets, doors etc. He'll go into the kitchen, fashion steps out of randomly placed object in the kitchen [chairs, boxes, garbage can, etc] and get into the higher cabinets. 

Last night, for example, he thought it would be a great idea to break several eggs on the floor and mix them with flower. 

Anyway, what can I do to set my child's sleep schedule straight.
