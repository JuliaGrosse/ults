TITLE: My [20M] ex gf [21F] of 2 years had sex with 2 other guys soon after we broke up, now she is behaving like we're still together, don't know what to do
POST: It's been almost 2 months since we broke up. We still live together in a shared student house. Within a week or two after breaking up she has unprotected sex with a guy she met on tinder after a first date. I found out by seeing the morning after pill  in her bag whilst looking for something to help her, since she came home too drunk to look after herself after a night out. 

At first I denied to myself that she had actually done it because I love her and it is out of her character but once I admitted it to myself I confronted her a few days later. I did this because she slept with me (unprotected also) and acted all lovey on the night she was drunk. She went bright red and seemed very apologetic, she said she thought I was doing the same and wanted to get over me because she thought there was no chance of us getting back together.

A few weeks later whilst we were out together in town having a few drinks and chatting, she tells me about how she gave a guy a blowjob after their first date. She frames it in a way to try and say how I'm better than the other guys but to me it just came off as disrespectful and manipulative to tell me that.

Now she has been acting like we're together and being affectionate, getting annoyed if I don't reply to her texts. I love her so much and I don't think she's messing around with other guys anymore however I can't tell if this was a moment of madness or an indicator of who she is deep down. To make matters worse we still live in the same house and will have to for the next 6 months. Should I try to be friendly with her? Should I eventually give her another chance? How would I get over her when we still live together?
