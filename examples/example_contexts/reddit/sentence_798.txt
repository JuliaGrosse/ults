TITLE: Is friendship possible after break up?
POST: My [28 M] girlfriend [29 F] of 4 years broke up with me in February citing personal problems (mental issues) and the need for space and time to work things out, though she said she would like us to come back sometime. 

I accepted it because our relationship was going downhill and we're in good therms. 

At first she tried to stay in touch almost hourly, but I asked for silence to get used to her absence, now we text eachother weekly. 

If nothing else, I really want us to be friends in the future because I really care for her and because I do need her friendship. 

But I'm affraid that things cool down way too much and that we're unable to connect again. 

How much time should I wait? 

What kind of contact should I keep?
TL;DR:
