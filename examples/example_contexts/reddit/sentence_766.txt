TITLE: Hetero Couple [30s] together three years. We need a way to stop taking each other for granted.
POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, we are both in our 30s and I can tell we are definitely taking each other for granted.  

For me, I just find myself focusing on his faults and not feeling thankful for the good stuff.  I find myself crushing out on his friends or just fantasizing about having relationships with some of them because they seem like "better" versions of him (more romantic, better listeners, more career-focused, whatever). It's like being together so long and being exposed to each other has made us sort of "immune" to each other's charms.  

We still go out on dates, I still keep myself looking good and dress up for him, we talk about marriage and make plans for the future, but even that doesn't feel very romantic anymore, just inevitable.

I know the minute we broke up, all the good, wonderful, unique things about him will come flooding back, but I just don't feel like I can access them now. And the same for him about me.  They feel buried under layers of nights home watching TV and routine sex (at least every night or morning, sometimes both).
TL;DR:
