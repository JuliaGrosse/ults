TITLE: I [22/F] told my boyfriend [26/M] that I love him and he hasn't said it back.
POST: My boyfriend and I have been together since late February or early March 2014. I said "I love you" to him a while ago (probably in August?) and he hasn't said it back. He has said it a couple times when he's been drunk but I don't know of that counts. He is always doing and saying other things that make me feel special and loved, but I feel like something is missing because he doesn't say he loves me.

I have told him that it's hard for me to feel like things are one sided and that I don't make him feel the way that he makes me feel. He was very understanding but he still hasn't said it to me. I have not told him that I feel like if he doesn't love me by now, he isn't going to.

It's frustrating because I want to say it to him so often because he does all these little things that just make me so happy but I'm afraid of the awkwardness and hurt feelings that will follow when he doesn't reciprocate. 

I do not feel like I should break up with him at all, as every other aspect of the relationship is awesome and I'm very happy. Am I making too big of a deal about this?
TL;DR:
