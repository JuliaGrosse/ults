TITLE: Me [27F] pregnant with my boyfriend's [27M] baby. Cannot afford the baby, but terrified of abortion due to PCOS. What if I can never conceive again?
POST: As the title suggests, I found out today I am pregnant (not planned) with my boyfriend's baby. I told him immediately, and he offered his support regardless of my decision. From a financial point of view, I know the answer but emotionally I am a mess. 

A bit of background. I suffer from PCOS, and have worked hard in the last two years to better my condition as much as possible through diet and exercise. I am currently attending graduate school, which is very stressful and pays very little. My boyfriend, "Leo" works full time and is doing his undergrad, both of which are very stressful situations for him. Money wise, the two of us are ok, but no way could we afford a baby in this situation.

We briefly discussed that the best option is to terminate and while I know that to be the best course, I am so afraid of the consequences. One of my life dreams is to be a mother, and I thought maybe I never would be (naturally) due to my condition. Now that it has happened, I am floored. Because we are thinking of terminating, I can't talk to anyone about this so I am using this space to just vent and get my thoughts out there. 

Has anyone here experienced PCOS, got pregnant and terminated, and went on to have another pregnancy to term? I should note I do not know how long I am, (took the hCG test, found out today) and will be meeting with my doctor to find out more details. Is there anything I should bring up to her? I am sorry if this isn't the right place for this.
TL;DR:
