SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [24 M] met a girl [21 F] a couple weeks ago at a work function and she seemed cool, so we went to lunch and hit it off, but she lives with her ex.
POST: Early in June my workplace had a social event for employees, and I met a pretty girl from another department who seems like the kind of partner I'm looking for. Interested to learn more about one another, we went out to lunch recently.

 

At lunch we talked about where we're from, our work, and our hobbies. We got along really well, but what struck me as odd is that she lives in an apartment with her ex-BF. I don't know any details since I didn't want to push the topic on our first meeting. But it seems like a big red flag to me.

 

I haven't been in a "first-date" scenario in a long time, and I've never encountered this situation before, nor known a friend in this situation. Do any of you have some experience to share to help me figure out if this is a relationship worth pursuing?

 

I'd definitely want to know how long they were together, how long ago & why they broke up, and the reason they're still living together. I'd understand a little better if they were older and more established with their job and household, when it was harder to pick up and move, but they're both young and in school. I know her family lives in town as well.

 

If she doesn't care about living with her ex, my fear is that it may mean she doesn't value relationships or invest herself in them as much as I do. Then again, maybe the breakup was recent and they haven't been able to move out yet.
TL;DR:
