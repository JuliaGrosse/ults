SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: r/relationships, I need a peptalk. I've found someone I really care about, but a painful breakup in my past keeps rearing its head in the back of my mind.
POST: I [17/F] recently started dating a new girl [20], and she's really great. She's the first girl that I've dated for longer than a month in a long time, and I see no signs of slowing down. I'm actually in a honeymoon phase, as opposed to some of my previous relationships where I only really liked the attention I got and very rapidly lost interest after we were dating. 

Everything is great as far as my girlfriend and I are concerned. But about a year ago I had a nasty breakup with my first love [18]. We were together for three years, started dating young (from middle school into junior year of high school, so we had that young person growing up together bond going on), were conjoined at the hip and best friends, the whole nine yards. 

Even though everything is going perfectly well with my new girlfriend, I can't help but be afraid that it's going to end in a horrific crash just like my relationship with my first girlfriend did.
TL;DR:
