SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I am struggling with the idea that I (M 22) may never have sex with my partner (F 27). Any advice?
POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half and have recently been talking about getting engaged, but there is one serious issue that is making me think twice, and I need some advice.

My girlfriend was married to a guy she met years ago. They were young, stupid, and not really in love but they felt it's what "God wanted for them." So they did it, unhappily, and got a divorce a year or two after.

The problem I have with it is they never had sex. Any time he wanted to have sex, she always refused and instead made him do things with her. Essentially, she used him for sex without ever returning the satisfaction.

Additional details about her include being diagnosed with narcissism, depression, and currently seeing a therapist about those two things. Anything in life often has to revolve around her. Sex is definitely one of those things.

She has gone through that before and realizes that I will not go into a marriage without a sexual relationship being there. I truly believe that she wants it, I just don't know if it's going to happen and in the back of my mind there's the idea that I will never have sex with this woman. And that is frightening, to be honest.

Every fight we get into seems to be about intimacy.

Is there any advice you have? Counseling is something we've discussed many times but quite frankly we don't have the money right now.
TL;DR:
