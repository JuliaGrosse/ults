SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [M/22] think figured out why I have a fear of commitment last night, and I want to know if its a reasonable diagnosis!
POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

What do you guys think? Is this fear of failure a common occurrence? Does it lead to fear of commitment? Personal stories are welcome! How did you get over it? etc...
TL;DR:
