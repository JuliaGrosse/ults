TITLE: Tortoise or Hare? A question about plateaus.
POST: First off, thank you guys for all your support and encouragement!  I definitely couldn't have gotten so far in my weightloss journey without this community.

I guess I have hit a bit of a snag, in that I've lost about 2/3 of my goal and am slowing down.  Everybody talks about doing big shocks to your system like eating more or less or drastically changing their excercise to bust through a plateau, but I'm worried something like that may derail me to be quite honest.  I am hoping someone can share any experience that if I just keep on keeping on (eating 1200 calories/day)  I can get through a plateau, even if it is very slowly.
TL;DR:
