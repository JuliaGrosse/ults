TITLE: Should I [M23] tell my friend [23F] (again) about how I feel for her?
POST: We're attending the same school and have recently become really good friends - she invites me over for dinner, we go bowling together and so forth. 

At first I was somewhat surprised of the enthusiasm she showed when I first asked her about doing things, then I later learned that her relationship with her boyfriend of 1,5yrs had for the last few months kind of 'evened out', if you will.

I was and am still attracted to her and thinks she's a fantastic person. I've already let her know about the situation and she's told me then that she was really unsure of what to do. 
On one hand she's really fond of her BF and doesn't want to end what they have because it's safe and that she doesn't have a 'valid' reason for breaking up. 
On the other hand she's told me that if she'd been single the choice would've been easy.

Now, they've been abroad together for a few days and they just got back. I don't know if the trip strengthened their bond, but what I do know is that I'm still quite fond of her and in my head I'm sort of imagining that she /really/ wants to be with me instead.

So, I don't want our friendship to end, but as it is now I think it's difficult being together when what I really want is to perhaps have more than a friendship.

What should I tell her and what should I do? I'm afraid to sacrifice our good friendship if I tell her how it is, at the same time I'm having a hard time always being doubtful wether or not she wants to be more than friends. Even though she hasn't directly said so, I feel as if all the attention she's giving me is serving as a clear indicator.
TL;DR:
