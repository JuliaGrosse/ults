TITLE: If you don't jerk off with us and prove you can cum, you aren't a man. What is the most hurtful thing your friends have done to you?
POST: I was in the 7th grade at the time and on new years eve I was invited to a friends party. So I went over to their house to chill with a group of people. Eventually near the end people left and it was just two of my friends and myself left.

We were in my friends computer room when one of them suggested that we jerk off together from watching porn on his computer. They basically came to a concession to jerk off together and needless to say I was not cool with it, it was extremely awkward. 

They were trying to get me to jerk off with them and my refusal was seen as me not proving my manhood to them. I straight up told them that it was fucked up and I refused to do that while they were around. They then gave me an alternative and told me to jerk it in the bathroom onto tissue and show it to them. I said I wouldn't do that either.

Needless to say they started doing the 'deed' while I was sitting in front of them. I was disgusted and when one of my friends finished, he threw his jizz rag at me. I got up and just left in disgust.

The next day at school, they told some people that I refused to jerk off with them or at least jerk off in private to prove my manhood. I felt a great deal of shame (I was a late bloomer) and was hurt by my friends. 

So Reddit, I ask you.. What is the most hurtful thing your friends have done to you?
