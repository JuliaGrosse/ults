SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [22 M] broke up with my fiancé [23 F] 3.5 years, not sure if it's amicable or not.
POST: Yesterday I ended my relationship. I'd been thinking about it for a while, but it came to the point where I had to choose between what was *easy* and what was *right*. My heart was pounding in my chest when I was going to do it, and I cried when I left, but I feel like we both handled it very well.

She texted me this morning to say that she thinks its the best thing to do on reflection. I know that doesn't make it OK, but I'd rather break up on these decent terms than the relationship have gotten to a point where we hated each other.

That's the hardest thing. I do love her, I just had to end the relationship because I didn't want the future we were heading towards, and you only live once (sorry for the cliché).

My issue is that I feel like she's upset, but she's OK with it, but then again I think she is trying to stay strong because she thinks it's right. I just didn't expect this. 

I want this to be an amicable breakup. and there was no outside influence, I'm not seeing somebody else or anything, I just wanted it to end. I feel awful. Sorry, had to get this off my chest. Is it normal to feel like things are OK, or is even this breakup doomed to mean that we have a really sour relationship afterwards?

We're meeting up in the next few days to talk about sorting out the house (we rented together for 20 months).

I'm feeling confident, and I'm a roller coaster ride of emotions right now. Relief, panic (about what I'm gonna do), and sadness being the main ones. I'm usually very calculated and prepared, but this went out of the window yesterday. Any advice would be great.
TL;DR:
