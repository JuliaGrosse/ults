TITLE: Interviewing for over a month for a position I just learned (during my f2f interview on Monday) had already been filled. They said they couldn't decide between our candidacies so they're looking to hire us both.
POST: This is my first post, so I apologize if this has already been touched on. I couldn't find a similar post so here goes:

I was recruited for and have been interviewing for a position for about a month. They seemed highly enthusiastic, I made myself extremely available for interviews so that they all happened in relatively rapid succession in mid July and they asked that I come in for a face to face. The job is in the Netherlands (I live in the UK) so I bought a ticket to meet the first week of August. 

The interview went great. I met everyone in the small company, we got along famously... and then they mentioned that one of the guys I had just met had been hired a few weeks before and technically filled the position I had been interviewing for BUT that they had been unable to choose between the two candidacies so they were looking to hire us both.

I don't know what to make of this situation. How did this guy get hired so quickly? Does this mean I will be considered expendable if the company realizes an extra person is unnecessary? Most importantly, should I email the interviewer and vocalize my concerns? If so, how should I phrase it?

It's worth noting that at the start of all this, they emphasized that they needed someone who spoke French (this guy doesn't, but I do) and that they were interested in branching out into social media if I would be interested in taking on the challenge (but in the f2f interview, I was told there was already someone who did that and "maybe I could help him"). I don't have loads of experience in the working world yet and I tend to just be grateful someone wants to hire me, but now I'm afraid I'm being scammed or led on (or maybe I'm just overthinking it and being excessively paranoid)...
TL;DR:
