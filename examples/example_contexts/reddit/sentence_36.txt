SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [18 M] with my boyfriend [24 M] 4 months dating, I lied.
POST: I met this guy on grindr(gay hookup app) and we hooked up one day when I went to a college visit in Michigan. The first night we had sex, but he came for second night and we just talked until we both fell asleep. We decided to keep in touch until I graduated high school and came to school there. (I was still 18)

Ever since then we have been texting and face timing everyday(building trust etc.) Since then I have asked if he has hooked up with anyone since we met and he said no. 1st red flag. He has hooked up with someone, he didn't know I'd remember but he told me a month into our relationship. I figured at least he was honest and didn't think too much of it.

Recently I went to New York by myself to tour the city at night because I had never seen what it looked like before, I live in NJ. In the end I ended up calling him because I was at Penn station and it was about 4 in the morning. I made up this story that I came to new York, met up with my roommate & his older brother, we went to a hookah bar, and they got drunk so I left. the story itself wasn't very believable and he caught on and told me he had a hard time believing me, and hung up.

I texted him and told him I was sorry that I lied and I promised I'd never do it again. He sent me a picture of his gay hookup app of people messaging him and told me that he was at a hookups, house right now and I told him I wanted to keep trying with him either way I didn't care. He said he wasn't mad at me but in turn he would not apologize for hooking up, lying, and he would not delete his app. I accepted the consequences for my lies and told him that I still wanted to keep trying with him. Since then he un-followed me on instagram and I don't know how to start a conversation with him anymore, everything I say will just sound like another lie to him. I haven't tried texting or calling him ever since then.
TL;DR:
