TITLE: Is my [25/F] boyfriend [27/M] of almost two years insecure/clingy or something else?
POST: My boyfriend and I always talk on the phone before we go to bed, but sometimes either I won't hear my phone or the phone will just send my calls to voice mail. Last night I didn't hear the phone go off, and I found that within 5 minutes my boyfriend had called me twice and texted me twice. He has done this once before many months ago but he stopped when I asked him to. When I asked why he called so much he says it's because he loves me and he worries about me living on my own. But when I ask him to elaborate on what exactly scares him about me being on my own he says he doesn't know. The only answer he gave is "but I love you,"

I know he's a very sensitive guy and he's been dealing with some anxiety off and on throughout the relationship but I don't think he's really addressing it. Now that I'm looking back on my relationship, I'm wondering if there were red flags that maybe he's just super clingy or something. Or rather I will tell myself something is a red flag when it's probably not (saying I love you after only 3 months, discussing moving in together/marriage at around a year, that sort of thing). It's possible that I'm just freaking out about nothing.

I've been having my own issues with (unofficially undiagnosed) with ROCD or relationship obsessive compulsive disorder, where I feel the need to obsess over my relationships. Is calling like that in such a short period of time a red flag, or maybe I've reached a stage of ROCD where I start to feel stifled by the relationship. 

I know I love my boyfriend very much, and I'm sorry that this post kind of took off in a different direction, but should I be feeling concerned? Is it possible he could end up being controlling or something? Thank you!!
TL;DR:
