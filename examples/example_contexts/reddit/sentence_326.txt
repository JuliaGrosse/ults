SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My GF [22 F] loves me, but I [22 M] don't feel the same. I don't want to end up hurting her
POST: We have been dating for about a month and a half, and at first it was her idea to keep it very casual. I agreed, because I had never been in a serious relationship before and I wasn't sure what to expect with one. But after a few weeks she was already telling me she was falling for me, and soon she would flat out tell me how much she loved me.

I honestly care about her, and I like her a lot, but I know I don't love her and I feel like an asshole for it. When she says it I just try and act like it's not a big deal and that it doesn't bother me, but at this point I don't know what to say anymore. She makes me feel overwhelmed and smothered by how much she is depending on me.

I know the relationship can't last much longer, but she is going through a really shitty time in her life right now and I don't want to add to it. She broke up with her last boyfriend of one year about a week before we started dating, she is changing jobs, and adjusting to living on her own in a new place.

We don't really fight much and we get along great, but our personalities are just too different for each other. She tells me how much more caring I am than her last boyfriends, which I think is why she feels like she loves me, but I feel sure I'll never feel the same way about her.

I don't know what I should do, should I simply tell her? Should I break up with her? I want to try and talk out my feelings but I know how she feels already, and if I tell her how I feel I'll crush her.
TL;DR:
