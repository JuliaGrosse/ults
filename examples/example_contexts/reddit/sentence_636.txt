TITLE: TIFU trying to taking pizza out of the oven
POST: This happened about 20 minutes ago and my heart is still pounding. Had a craving for some deep dish pizza, so I decided to make one. Spent 2 hours making the dough and sauce and shredding the fresh mozzarella. It was going to be fantastic. I put it all together, then into the oven. Cut to 30 minutes later, when it is time to come out. Stupid me, thinks that it will be like taking a regular pizza out of the oven. NOPE! The entire contents of said pizza spill out, all over the oven and the door and my kitchen floor. This is when things started to get fun. The spill sent a giant whoosh of steam out into my apartment, resulting in the smoke detector going off, causing my dog to start freaking out. I quickly run over to the smoke detector to turn that off, but thats when then dog stops barking and notices the massive pile is hot cheese and meaty tomato sauce all over the floor. I run back to the oven attempting to get him away from the spill (luckily he is small so I can easily over power him) but that's when he starts barking again. I guess he was pissed that I didn't let him eat the cheese. Ended up sitting on the floor of my kitchen with one leg stretched out keeping the dog away while attempting to clean up as much of the cheesy spill as I can without burning myself in the oven that had just been set at 425 degrees. Worst part of the whole experience is, I don't even get to satisfy my craving for deep dish pizza now. It's just crust with essence of toppings.
TL;DR:
