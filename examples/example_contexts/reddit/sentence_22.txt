TITLE: My [21f] boyfriend [22m] friends are excluding him [22m,21m] after he invited them places together
POST: I just don't understand why this happens. It's happened to me before too. 

My boyfriend Ben* has been friends with Tim* since they were 5 and Jo* since they were 16. Tom and Jo never hung out alone. Ben recently invited Tim and Jo out all the time because Tim broke up with his girlfriend. They saw a movie together and went out together about 5 times with Ben Tim and Jo and other assorted male friends of Ben.

Now Tim and Jo see each other all the time and don't invite Ben. This really upsets Ben. They go and see movies and go out clubbing. Ben just invited Tim somewhere and he told him that he already has plans with Jo. 

Ben is justifiably upset. I am just wondering why this happens. It may sound really silly but i have had this happen to me before as well. I am confused. It seems really rude. I have always been inclusive instead of exclusive and when I organise anything I always invite everyone I think may want to come even if I know they won't. I have never done this to anyone ever. But it's obviously a common thing.

I'm just wondering why. And how to go about fixing this? Ben is so hurt. Is it the kind of thing you just leave it and don't say anything? Ben has already mentioned that he was kind of hurt about it to Jo but they still aren't inviting him.

*shitty made up fake names
