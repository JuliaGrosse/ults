TITLE: My boyfriend's [M28] touch no longer feels good and he's lost desire for sex with me [F23]. Help!
POST: We've been together for about two years, largely long distance with semi-monthly visits and some longer periods (2+ months) being together. We've been poly/non-monogamous the entire time, and I have another boyfriend (of 1 year now), he has some casual partners.

Lately, things feel very shaky between us. 
We still appreciate and support each other a lot, and there's a lot of affection and humour and enjoying each other's presence, but there appears to be at least three problems:

- He doesn't want sex with me anymore (but does still have sex with others, we're non-monogamous) - if I initiate he might have sex with me, but doesn't come or seem to enjoy it

- Somehow his hugs and kisses, that used to make me feel euphoric, now often has me feeling indifferent or even annoyed sometimes, especially if I'm trying to focus on something else

- He doesn't understand the depression that has crept up on me in the past 3/4 year; the idea of being sad for no particular reason or just because of a general sense of lostness is totally incomprehensible for him, and the lack of understanding feels like a wall between us. When I can't muster up any enthusiasm for any particular activity, he feels rejected and helpless.

To deal with the last point I've tried explaining the feelings I'm having (without much success) and found him some resources for how to deal with a depressed partner and understand symptoms, hoping it might sink in eventually. For the other two points, I feel completely at a loss as to how to fix it...does anyone have any advice or experiences to share about this kind of situation? It hurts quite a bit and feels very scary
TL;DR:
