TITLE: What jobs should I apply for?
POST: I recently graduated with an M.A. in English Composition and Rhetoric with an emphasis on technical/professional writing. From my numerous jobs, internships and volunteer positions I actually have several years of experience with event planning, managing a team, fundraising, doing research and analysis (in both academic and business settings) and professional writing and editing (I have written several grant proposals, training manuals, press releases and other documents for real-world implementation and I have edited or assisted on several national publications). 

I love planning events like academic conferences or charity galas, but I can't imagine a life of primarily planning weddings and sweet 16 parties. I have applied for a few event planner jobs at local universities, but they are few and far between and the competition is fierce. I have also applied for jobs doing technical writing or corporate communications/PR, and some research analyst positions, but again these seem hard to come by. I would love to work for a non-profit, but none in my area are hiring right now (though a few have said I will be their first call if they ever do hire, because I already volunteer for them and they know I rock). I wouldn't mind writing advertising copy or doing market research, but I refuse to do direct sales. I am stuck in my general geographic area (central oklahoma).

So, what other types of jobs should I be looking at? Are there any kick-ass careers that haven't occurred to me but that would be a good fit for my skills?
TL;DR:
