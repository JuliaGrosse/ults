TITLE: I can't kiss for shit.
POST: At this rave I was attaining there was this girl I fancied for a while which had to work and could party for a short time with us, in a really let's say clear moment I told a friend of mine that I liked her and she told me to go after her and say it. So I did, she said she thought she liked me and we went to some place and she kissed me but I pretty much failed horribly and even thinking about that peculiar moment, the kiss that just didn't work has made me cringe 100 times, kinda ruined my space but damn, I just can't controll the thoughts, suddenly I bust myself facepalming or saying something along the lines of  ugh. I just hope this doesn't ruins things any soon, friends have said it won't but I'm not too sure.
TL;DR:
