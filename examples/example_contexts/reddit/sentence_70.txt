TITLE: I need your help Reddit. I'm getting screwed by American Family Insurance.
POST: I need your help Reddit.

I was recently in a car accident where the other driver was at fault. They turned through a stopped lane of traffic turning into a parking lot and hit me in the second lane. Their insurance agency accepted fault for the accident. They arranged for me to get a rental car and are paying for the auto body repair at the shop my dealer recommended. 

Now here is where I ran into a problem. 

I have limited liability insurance on my car because I worked like a boss and saved my money up and paid for it out right so I would not go into debt. I took the risk of not covering the cost of damage to my car for when I am at fault because I have a clean record of driving and am willing to replace my car with a Junker if I wreck it. The amount I have saved not covering my car is enough to buy a replacement car. Anyways, when I picked up the rental car that the at fault insurance company (American Family) paid for, I had to sign for the coverage that the rental company (Enterprise) offers, and is $13 a day, since I do not have full coverage. Makes since. I contacted the at fault insurance company (American Family) and explained this to them and explained that this expense is a result of the accident that their client caused and that they should take responsibility. They flat out said they understand why they should pay for it but they do not have to. My car will not be out of the shop for another 2 weeks and I will end up getting stuck with a $300 and something bill for the insurance. 

I am a student and just paid for classes and have to pick up books this week and can not afford this. Please tell me if I have any options. The logic of how they can get away with out paying for this escapes me.  By the way, my insurance company pays for rental insurance when their client is at fault.
