Masters champion Jordan Spieth is back to work this week at the RBC Heritage Classic after two days celebrating his victory at Augusta National and being showered with attention. Spieth arrived at Sea Pines Resort late Tuesday night after a media whirlwind in New York since tying Tiger Woods' Masters record of 18-under 270 to capture the green jacket. The 21-year-old said it was a dizzying stretch with 26 appearances and interviews in 25 hours. 'It was a little crazy in New York having paparazzi know where we were going to eat dinner even though we never told anybody,' Spieth said Wednesday. Spieth doesn't believe the success will change him. In fact, he said he upheld his commitment to the RBC Heritage in part to chase down Rory McIlroy for world No. 1. 'I wouldn't come to a tournament just to come to a tournament, especially with that goal still in mind,' said Spieth, who moved to No. 2 in the world rankings with the Masters' win. Jordan Spieth returns to golf just days after winning the Masters and will play in the RBC Heritage Classic. Spieth has had two victories and two runner-up finishes in his past four events. He would have liked to have had his normal pre-tournament preparations at Harbour Town Golf Links. Instead, he'll go into his first-round tee time Thursday not having played a hole of practice on the tricky, Pete Dye-designed layout.
