A woman who ended up getting lost while running a marathon in Raleigh, North Carolina and ended up having to hitch a ride with the cops to get back on course, still won her race some nine minutes ahead of her closest competitor. Heidi Bretscher's troubles began around mile 17 of the Rock N' Roll Raleigh Marathon that took place earlier this month. The 28-year-old runner was so far ahead of the pack it wasn't clear to her which way she was meant to go. Wrong way: Heidi Bretscher, 28, said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she, and the two cyclists who were accompanying her, missed an unmarked turn. Retracing her steps: At mile 19, Bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She found a police officer who gave her a ride back to mile 17. Somehow, she ended up running entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course. Despite her unscheduled detour, Ms. Bretscher's was brought back on track by a couple of helpful cops who drove her in their patrol cars back to the point in the race where things became muddled. After working out her timings and distances she still managed to cross the line well ahead of her closest rival. 'I'm a little frustrated,' she told ABC 11 following her victory. 'I ran three miles off course because I didn't know which way to run in the race.'
