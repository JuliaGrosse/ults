The end-of-season awards will go to the best attacker but if there was a Defender of the Year, John Terry would clean up. Nobody else would get close. This has been his best season in a Chelsea shirt. Two seasons ago Rafa Benitez said he couldn’t cope with two games a week. That will have frightened the life out of John. So credit Jose Mourinho for trusting him and building that defence around him. Terry has never had pace but that is not a problem as he reads the game so well. He didn’t break sweat against Arsenal and Chelsea were too streetwise for Arsene Wenger’s team. John Terry celebrates after the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium. Chelsea are undefeated against the top four this season where Arsenal have lost twice — that is the gap Wenger’s side need to bridge and Terry has been a huge part of that. I remember playing against him early in his career and after I tackled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, he clattered right into me — he wasn’t going to let me put one on his team-mate. That’s when I knew he could grow up to be a special player. Terry  celebrates with his team-mates after the Premier League draw against Arsenal in north London. One Hull of a result. Beating Crystal Palace was a massive result for Steve Bruce. Their run-in is horrendous and had they lost at Selhurst Park
