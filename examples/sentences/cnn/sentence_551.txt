Candlestick Park is no more. The iconic sports field, completed in 1960 and home to first the San Francisco Giants and later the San Francisco 49ers, has been torn down to make way for houses, a hotel and a shopping center. And in 55 years there was a lot of wind and a whole lot of fog, but there were also some remarkable moments thanks to the one of the greatest to every play football, the music of The Beatles, and one incredibly ill-times natural disaster. Scroll down for video. Candlestick park, which has been home to the San Francisco Giants and San Francisco 49ers, has been torn down. The area is now set to become houses, a hotel and a shopping center. Members of the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants gather on the field with their families and security personnel after an earthquake struck prior to game three of the World Series on October 17, 1989. Joe Montana (above in 1989) led the 49ers to four Super Bowls while playing at Candlestick. While Candlestick began as the home of the Giants, it also became home to the 49ers beginning in 1971. It had previously served as the home field for the Oakland Raiders for part of the 1960 and all of the 1961 season, but it was the 49ers who truly made their mark. And in their 43 seasons at candlestick, no player was bigger to the organization than Joe Montana, who would ultimately lead the team to four Super Bowl victories,
