A 21-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder after allegedly shooting dead his fiancée at their Minnesota home on  Easter morning while holding their baby daughter in his arms. Dimitri Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and pointed it at 19-year-old Samirria White after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am. Carrying the couple's three-month-old child, he then shot Miss White in the face at close range, according to police. When medics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the young mother dead. Now, Harrell, who later admitted to having stored his handgun under his daughter's mattress, has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court.
