It was once the edgiest place in town, attracting the word's biggest bands to its iconic stage - but 30 years later Cleveland's Variety Theater is silent. The venue was renowned for its rock concerts but everything changed in 1984 when heavy metal band Motorhead played a gig so loud it literally began to bring the house down. As the crowd went wild over the group's unique ear-shattering brand of music, the ceiling cracked and pieces of plaster began to fall on the audience - ending the concert and the life of the Variety Theater in one deafening shriek. Abandoned for 30 years: The Variety Theater in Cleveland was once a buzzing music venue but was closed down after the ceiling cracked during a Motorhead gig in 1984. The power was cut off to stop the band from playing and two years later a judge ordered the theater to be sealed off for good. Built in 1927, The Variety Theater was home to one of the earliest single screen cinemas in Cleveland, Ohio, before becoming an iconic music venue. The 20,000 sq ft main stage hosted the likes of  Metallica, the Dead Kennedy's and R.E.M. before Motorhead's fatal performance on December 2 1984. Since then it has stayed abandoned and hidden from public eye until now, thirty years later, a photographer has captured a collection of eery images offering a fascinating glimpse into music history.
