He’s a TV star with a love for adventure, so it’s no wonder Ben Fogle looks for somewhere a little bit extraordinary for his holiday. My husband and I see the TV star lazing with his little boy by one of the five swimming pools in the Martinhal Beach Resort in Portugal, soaking up the sun. The high-end resort, which opened in 2010, is renowned as being one of the best in the Algarve for a luxury family holiday. The beautiful Martinhal is a hit with families - and TV stars such as Ben Fogle. But despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes, the water is cold. Martinhal, which boasts a fine-dining restaurant, is the only five-star resort in the area to have direct access to a beach, and is set within 25 hectares in the protected Costa Vicentina Natural Park. So we’ve come to check it out – after all, why should the kids have all the fun? From the balcony in our chic Beach Room, we are afforded an incredible view over the glistening waters of the North Atlantic Ocean from the most south-westerly point in the Algarve. But despite the sun shining for around 300 days of the year here and the golden sand being warm beneath your toes, don’t be fooled – the sea is sharp-intake-of-breath cold.
