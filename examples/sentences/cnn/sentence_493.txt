A Russian warship and two bombers strayed close to UK territory yesterday in yet another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences. A destroyer equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel along with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. A map showing the how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth yesterday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel. Just a few hours later, two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace – prompting the RAF to deploy two Typhoon fighter jets. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on a huge Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled. No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression.
