Sri Lanka, with its shimmering sandy beaches, enthralling wildlife and relics of ancient civilisations, is high on lists of places to visit in 2015. Gareth Huw Davies enjoys the new stability on the teardrop-shaped island in the Indian Ocean, where the holiday industry is recovering, and expanding with a crop of smart new hotels, after the dual torment of a tsunami and a bitter civil war. The modern Seema Malaka temple, Colombo, Sri Lanka. The temple floats on Colombo's Beira Lake. 1...Pure serendipity. This is the spiritual home of serendipity – lucky discoveries by accident – as Serendib is the island’s ancient name. It happens everywhere. On one of my early starts for an excursion, serendipity was seeing dozens of candles flickering in the dense dark outside a Buddhist temple. Then a schoolgirl in brilliant white uniform striding through the dawn mists along a levee between paddy fields, while an equally white egret paced daintily in the water. Or an old lady, knee-deep in a swamp picking blue water lilies, the national flower. And everywhere, games of impromptu cricket, with a stick for a bat and a plastic drum for a wicket, on bare mud patches, in gardens, on roads. Bath time! A frolicking elephant at the Uda Walawe nature reserve has around 200 of the giant creatures. 2
