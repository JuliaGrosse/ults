Pictures of Suge Knight showing he had virtually no facial injuries after he was arrested for killing one man and seriously injuring another in his pickup truck have been released. The co-founder of Death Row Records was punched a number of times during the deadly confrontation, but close-ups  taken by detectives show he only had a slight black eye. The images were released along with a number of key pieces of evidence as the court was shown footage of the deadly incident in Compton on January 18 for the first time. Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen reviewed the items before determining Knight, 49, should stand trial on murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges. Scroll down for video.

Another photo of the 49-year-old after he was detained was released by the court. Knight has pleaded not guilty to killing Terry Carter and trying to kill Cle 'Bone' Sloan. The close ups were intended to show the injuries he sustained from being punched in the face during the confrontation. Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen ruled Thursday that there was enough evidence for Knight, 49, to stand trial on charges he killed Terry Carter and attempted to kill Sloan during a parking lot confrontation.
