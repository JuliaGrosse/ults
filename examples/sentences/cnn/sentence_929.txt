Terrorist group ISIS has released photographs of its militants destroying Christian graves with sledgehammers and carving out crosses in the Iraqi city of Mosul. It's the latest shocking act by the Islamists who are waging a campaign of terror against other religions that has involved mass beheadings and raping. The group released a statement with the images that attempted to justify the mass desecration. It said that graves above the ground suggested that the dead person was closer to Allah than the living, so must be demolished and any images on the graves must be erased. The statement stems from a collection of Islamic teachings known as the hadith, which many Muslims reject. Steven Stalinsky, executive director of The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), told FoxNews.com that by posting the images on social media, the group was sending a message to the West. He said: 'It is important to note that ISIS is documenting its destruction and desecration of Christian sites and its attacks on Christian communities, and on other minorities' sites
