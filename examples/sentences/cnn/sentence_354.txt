Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982. Argentina has said it will prosecute oil companies operating off the Falklands coast, as tension rise on the 33rd anniversary of the conflict. Officials claim companies active there are acting 'illegally' in Argentine territory. It comes after Britain struck oil in the Falklands this week in a remote field of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. It comes just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a'very live threat' from Argentina. David Filmus, the Argentine minister in charge of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Latin America, said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk.' He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,' Mr Filmus said, adding that the process 'could end with an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters'. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations
