Sheriff Mbye, who died in hospital after receiving multiple stab wounds outside a KFC on Friday evening. A second 18-year-old has been arrested today on suspicion of murder after a teenager was stabbed to death outside a KFC restaurant. Sheriff Mbye, also 18, died in hospital after receiving multiple stab wounds in a scuffle outside the restaurant in Northfield, Birmingham on Friday afternoon. Today an 18-year-old from the Birmingham area was arrested at his home address on suspicion of murder. It comes after officers arrested another 18-year-old on suspicion of murder on Friday, with officers being granted more time to question the teenager. Police were called to Bristol Road South in Birmingham just before 5pm on Friday to reports of a stabbing outside a KFC restaurant. Officers found a 19-year-old man who has also suffered serious stab wounds being treated by customers at a nearby barbershop. Police then received reports that victim Mr Mbye had been dropped off at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham in a white Audi, which then sped off. But despite the best efforts of doctors, the 18-year-old died in hospital two hours later. Detectives launched a major murder investigation and the Audi was found abandoned in Ladywood, Birmingham, late on Friday night. Bristol Road South was reopened today but a scene is being preserved at the barber shop where the 19-year-old victim was treated by members of the public. Officers are also carrying out forensic examinations
