Sir Bradley Wiggins will bid for cycling's hour record on June 7 at London's Olympic Velodrome. The four-time Olympic champion and 2012 Tour de France winner, who is 35 on April 28, will attempt to add to his accomplishments by riding the furthest distance in 60 minutes at the Lee Valley VeloPark. 'The Hour Record is a holy grail for cyclists,' Wiggins said. Four-time Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins will bid to break cycling's hour record in June. Wiggins finished his Team Sky career in the Paris-Roubaix 253.5km one-day race on Sunday. Australian rider Rohan Dennis poses after breaking the world hour record on February 8 in Grenchen. 'It's been fought over tooth and nail by some of the greatest names in our sport for over a hundred years and it's time for me to have a crack at it. 'I like the idea of challenging myself and want to motivate people to do the same - so why not get your bike out of the shed and see how far you can go in an hour?' Wiggins, whose track pedigree includes three Olympic gold medals, is expected to set a mark which will last for some time. Wiggins will hope for a capacity 6,000 crowd to spur on his attempt, with tickets going on sale from April 19, while the event will be broadcast live on Sky Sports. In June, Wiggins will hope to race in front of a sell-out crowd at London's Olympic Velodrome
