Dementia could soon be treated with a 'brain pacemaker' inserted directly into the skull, according to new research. Scientists have shown that using deep brain stimulation (DBS), a technique already used to treat Parkinson's disease, can boost memory by causing new brain cells to be formed. A 'pacemaker' fitted with electrodes is inserted into the brain through holes drilled in the skull. Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat Parkinson's, but now researchers now believe it could be used to improve brain function and ward off diseases such as dementia (file image) Experiments on rats found the therapy improved their powers of recall, and it is hoped the same will apply to humans. The device sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain and has also been shown to provide benefits for a range of conditions including chronic pain, major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. The device was implanted into middle aged rats, sending out minute electrical impulses, and the study found the animals performed better in memory tests compared to those who had not been stimulated, even after 24 hours. Professor Ajai Vyas, of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said: 'Extensive studies have shown that rats' brains and memory systems are very similar to humans. 'The electrodes are harmless to the rats, as they go on to live normally and fulfil their regular adult lifespan of around 22 months.' DBS is a surgical procedure that has become an established NHS treatment  for Parkinson's sufferers whose condition
