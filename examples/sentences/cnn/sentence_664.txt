The latest app that's sweeping the web is the fiendishly addictive, and surprisingly difficult, Kuku Kube. It has been designed to put your colour vision and eyesight to the test by showing boards of coloured squares. On each board, one of the squares is a slightly different shade of the same colour and the aim is to find this odd square by tapping it with your finger or clicking it with the mouse. Click the Start button below to play Kuku Kube. Kuku Kube (pictured) is available for free on Facebook, Android, iOS and on desktop browsers. Scores lower than 11 are poor, scores between 15 and 20 is 'lower than average', 21 to 30 is considered normal or average, and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is considered great' Although the game appears relatively simple, and starts with a board of just four coloured squares, it quickly grows to a board of up to 81 squares. And the differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time. Players get a point for every correct square identified, but if they click or tap the wrong square they lose a point. Plus, players get just 60 seconds to find the odd square on each board before the timer runs out and the game ends.
