When walking into the backyard of your seaside condo, the only things you would hope to find are the waves lapping at the shore, or a sunset over the ocean. However, one Florida homeowner was shocked to find a nine foot bull shark swimming right past his back door. This incredible video captured the moment the extremely dangerous predator prowled past the property at the north end of Hickory Island, in Bonita Springs. This is the moment a nine foot long bull shark, considered among the deadliest in the world, was captured swimming past a condo back yard on Hikcory Island in Florida. The beast can be seen just under the the water, with its distinctive pectoral fin breaking the surface. Residents in Bonita Springs told NBC-2 that sharks began swimming up to their condos about a week ago, and have been spotted several times since. They say fishermen have been chumming the water - throwing in bait - which has been luring the animals back. Property owners are now asking the city to designate the area for swimming only, which would outlaw fishing there and, they hope, drive the sharks back out to sea. Bull sharks, along with great whites and tiger sharks, are generally considered among the most dangerous sharks in the world, and among the most likely to attack humans. Homeowners say fishermen throwing bait into the water nearby are attracting the predators to their homes, and are calling for fishing to be banned in the area. Adult bull sharks can grow up to 11.
