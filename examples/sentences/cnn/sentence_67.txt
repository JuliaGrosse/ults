Ryan Wray, 26, was formally charged with second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse on Friday. A former Utah State University fraternity president who was arrested in March on suspicion of sexual assault was officially charged in First District Court on Friday. Ryan Wray, 26, was charged with second-degree felony forcible sexual abuse in relation to a series of alleged assaults that occurred between last October and his March 24 arrest. Wray, who served as the 2013 and 2014 Pi Kappa Alpha president, was tasked with keeping safe women who 'could no longer take care of themselves' at parties at the off-campus frat house, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. A woman who went to a party at the 'Pike House' told police she awoke to find Wray 'touching her inappropriately without her approval' according to KSL. The woman, who said she was drunk at the time, discussed the incident with other women who then reported having similar experiences. When Wray was brought in by the Logan City Police Department for questioning, he confessed to groping the victim while she was passed out, the Herald Journal reported. He also admitted to groping two other women. So far only the first alleged victim filed a statement with police. All of the women were under 21. Wray was released on $10,000 bail after his arrest.
