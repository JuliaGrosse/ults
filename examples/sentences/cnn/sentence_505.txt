A black man has come out in support of police body cameras after he was gunned down by a white officer during a traffic stop and writhed in agony on the ground saying: 'Why did you shoot me sir?' Levar Jones, 36, who has no criminal record and was on his way home from his job at a Subway café, said the horror of his own shooting was brought home by the death of Walter Scott last week. He told Daily Mail Online he wanted to see non-lethal methods introduced for police, new training in them, and supported bodycams for officers. Mr Jones was confronted by a police officer opening fire at him as he followed instructions to produce his driver's license and was hit in the stomach. The horrifying incident was captured on the officer's dash cam and has led to the policeman Sean Groubert, 31, being fired and charged with a felony assault. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS.
