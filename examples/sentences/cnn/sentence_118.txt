John Carver says he will use a whip if he has to in a bid to motivate his Newcastle players ahead of Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby at the Stadium of Light. The Magpies have lost the last four matches against their North-East rivals and head coach Carver – who was assistant to Alan Pardew during that wretched run – admits that Sunderland wanted victory more than United on those occasions. ‘In the last four games Sunderland have out-worked us - and that's not a good stat to have,’ he said. John Carver says he will 'whip' his players to make sure they're motivated to beat Sunderland on Sunday. Dick Advocaat will take charge of his second game as boss and will want to keep Sunderland's record going. ‘I'll be making sure that doesn't happen again and I'll be using a whip to make sure we don't get out-worked.’ There is a suggestion that Newcastle will struggle for motivation given the comfort of their mid-table position compared to the Black Cats, who are fighting for Premier League survival. But Carver said: ‘I disagree, we’ve got everything to play for. That’s not just because of our respective league positions, we've lost the last four derbies and drawn the previous one.
