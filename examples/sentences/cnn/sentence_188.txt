Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has announced that he will undergo'very serious' surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen. In an emotional press conference on Thursday, the 45-year-old politician said he met with doctors who told him chemotherapy and radiation have shrunk the tumor to a size where they can operate. Four surgeons will carry out the eight- to ten-hour operation on May 11, and he will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, he said. He hopes to return to work in September. 'I'm just lucky to be alive today and I'm just lucky that I'm getting another chance at life,' he said. Scroll down for video.
