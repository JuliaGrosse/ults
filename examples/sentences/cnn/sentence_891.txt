Relatives of the victims of a South Korean ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people a year ago have held a rally demanding the government salvage the vessel. The 6,825-tonne passenger ship sank off the southwest coast on April 16 last year with most of the victims, high school students. Thousands of protesters met in the capital Seoul to call on officials to raise the Sewol after senior government officials said they would 'consider it.' Scroll down for video. One year on: Relatives of the victims of a South Korean ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people a year ago and other civic members shout slogans during a rally in Seoul, South Korea, on Saturday. A total of 295 bodies were recovered from the ferry, and nine victims remained unaccounted for when divers finally called off the dangerous search of its interior last November. The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests with hundreds of bereaved parents, many with their heads shaved and clad in white mourning robes, marching 22 miles to Seoul from their home town of Ansan last week. President Park Geun-Hye has pledged to 'actively consider' raising the Sewol, taking into account the opinions of the relatives and salvage experts. But senior government officials said the salvage operation would cost £68million. Senior ministry official Yeon Yeong-Jin said: 'And that is only an estimate, as the final cost would be greatly dependent on weather conditions, technological uncertainties.'
