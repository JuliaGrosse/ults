About 4.45 billion years ago, 150 million years after the solar system formed, Earth was hit by a Mars-size object called Theia. The collision created the moon, but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and Earth are so similar in their composition. Now, conflicting studies have provided two different theories - one that Theia was similar to Earth, and another that Earth and the moon were showered by debris following the collision. Three studies have provided different theories for what happened after Earth was struck by a Mars-sized object called Theia, 4.45 billion years ago. What is agreed on, though, is that the impact actually happened (artist's illustration shown). This is known as the giant impact hypothesis. The two theories appear in the journal Nature across three studies - two in favour of the ‘similar to Earth’ theory, and the other favouring the ‘shower of debris’ model. In the latter theory, a team of scientists at the University of Maryland said the impact of Theia with Earth was so violent, the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The coll
