Jeremy Clarkson will return to the BBC but not on Top Gear - even though bosses still haven't found his replacement. BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a new presenter for the show, said Clarkson 'will be back' on the BBC, despite his very public sacking from Top Gear just last month. Speaking today about the show's future, the executive insisted there was 'no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC' and that the 54-year-old would return to the corporation once he had 'had some time'.

The final scenes filmed by the Top Gear team (pictured) before Jeremy Clarkson was unceremoniously sacked from the show will be aired this summer, according to the head of BBC2. It comes as Ms Shillinglaw revealed that Clarkson's final moments on the motoring show would be aired this summer, saying that there was 'no way' she would let the material go to waste. She said: 'Jeremy will be back on the BBC. It's serious and unfortunate what happened but there is no ban on Jeremy being on the BBC. 'It's a a big deal what happened and Jeremy, as any human being would, needs some time.'
