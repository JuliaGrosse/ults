Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal says he has been dreaming of beating rivals City in Sunday's derby at Old Trafford but will have to do so without Robin van Persie. Van Persie said he was fit to feature in the game against City on Sunday after ankle trouble but Van Gaal has ruled him out. 'Most of the players are fit but being fit for me is different,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie will not return to the fray for Manchester United  against Manchester City on Sunday. Louis van Gaal explained at his press conference on Friday that Van Persie is not yet fit enough to play. United players train in the sunshine ahead of their game against local rivals City on Sunday. 'Robin is not fit enough to play.' With City rocking after defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday, Van Gaal and his players have an opportunity to finish as high as second or third  and avoid a Champions League qualifying fixture later in the summer. The United boss wants his side to move towards that target by taking all three points against City. Van Gaal said:'I dream of it. Every player should dream of the victory. 'Of course I want to win because it's a big step up the table also. If we win then third place is available.
