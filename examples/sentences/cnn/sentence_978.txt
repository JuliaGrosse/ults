Chris Sutton has told the SFA they must hold bungling officials to account. The former Celtic striker has branded additional official Alan Muir 'idiotic' for failing to see a handball by Inverness Caley Thistle defender Josh Meekings in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final. Meekings is now fighting a ban from the Scottish Cup Final following a Notice of Complaint from the SFA compliance officer.

Former Hoops striker Chris Sutton (pictured in 2005) has called for more accountability for officials. Insisting the officials should not escape scot free either, however, Sutton says Muir should be kept away from high-profile games if he's not up to the job. 'There's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that,' he insisted. 'It was just an absolute shocker. I just can't work out what he was thinking. 'It was just idiotic how he didn't see it. It wasn't a conspiracy, I just can't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close. 'There is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head, he must be an idiot not to see it. It's just ridiculous.' A goal ahead
