Trials: Researchers at Hadassah Medical SchoolÂ in Jerusalem found pregnancy helps regenerate tissue. Expectant mums really do bloom - for being pregnant has a'rejuvenating effect' on women, according to new scientific research. And for older women it could help them feel young again, almost literally, as pregnancy helps regenerate tissue and slow down the ageing process, it added. Appearing to bloom is not just a cosmetic side effect of carrying a child, said medical experts for the journal Fertility and Sterility but an actual physical process. Researchers studied the effects of liver transplants on pregnant and non-pregnant mice using a high-tech MRI scanner at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem. It found in young, non-pregnant mice, 82 per cent of the liver had regenerated after two days and in older, non-pregnant mice, only 46 per cent had regenerated in that time. But in older, pregnant mice around 96 per cent had regenerated after two days, better than the non-pregnant rodents both young and old, they reported. They also found that pregnancy protected the rodents from tissue damage around the heart, which is also an irreversible part of the human ageing process, said the study. Pregnancy is a unique condition for the human body, said the researchers, and as a result it has to cope with two people's systems at the same time. For the older of the two bodies, it is as if
