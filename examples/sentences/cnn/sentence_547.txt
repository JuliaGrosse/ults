Cyril Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib-Dem grandee in the years before he died. Nick Clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith yesterday by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician'. He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died. Mr Clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having 'washed his hands' of the issue by refusing to order a party investigation into Smith. He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party – a forerunner to the Lib Dems – offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police
