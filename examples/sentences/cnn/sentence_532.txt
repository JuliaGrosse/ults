(CNN)Thinking about presidential candidates?  Apparently, hormones are a major factor one should consider. According to one female businesswoman in Texas, Hillary Clinton shouldn't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she'll start an unnecessary war. When George W. Bush waged an unnecessary war in Iraq -- was his testosterone to blame? As Cheryl Rios, the CEO of Go Ape Marketing, sees it: "We're built differently, we have different hormones. In the world that we live in, I understand that there's equal rights and that's a wonderful thing and I support all of that. I don't support a woman being president." "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war," Rios wrote in a Facebook post. If Rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the Oval Office, she'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president. Throughout history, male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders' decision-making. Studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts. If science doesn't convince you, just Google "cheating politicians" for the long and sordid list of men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Sanford and John Edwards, whose hormones got the best of them. Rios has taken a lot of flak for her "biblically" inspired beliefs, but she's not the only one who's arguing that a woman's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern.
