(CNN)The Indonesian government has ordered preparations for the execution of 10 inmates on death row, including Filipino maid Mary Jane Veloso and Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Jakarta has advised consular officials to travel to Indonesia's "execution island" -- Nusa Kambangan -- where the ten are being held, though a spokesman for the Attorney General, Tony Spontana, told CNN Friday this is not the required 72-hour notice given to death row convicts before the actual execution. But he said, "the time is approaching." The 10 inmates, from Australia, France, Ghana, the Philippines, Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia, had their petitions for clemency denied by President Joko Widodo in late 2014. The executions, which will be carried out by firing squad, were planned for earlier this year but were postponed after several inmates filed separate legal challenges. On Tuesday, the Indonesian Supreme Court rejected reviews filed by French national Serge Atlaoui and Ghanaian Martin Anderson. "We're just waiting for one more decision on the judicial review filed by Zainal Abidin and we hope the Supreme Court's decision will come out tomorrow (Friday)," Spontana added. Abidin is also a drug convict and the only Indonesian citizen in the group. Chan and Sukumaran, members of the so-called "Bali Nine" convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot, tried to challenge the President's decision earlier this
