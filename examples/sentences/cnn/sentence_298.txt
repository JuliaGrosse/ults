Mark Selby was straight into an auspicious groove as he began his title defence at the Betfred World Championship on Saturday. The 31-year-old from Leicester rocked Ronnie O'Sullivan in last year's final to claim his maiden Crucible title, and returned to ease 6-3 ahead of Kurt Maflin in their first-round tussle.

Mark Selby plays a shot in the first round match against Kurt Maflin on day one of the World Championship. Mark Selby and Norwegian Kurt Maflin look on during their first round match at the Crucible in Sheffield. Selby salutes the Crucible crowd on his arrival.
