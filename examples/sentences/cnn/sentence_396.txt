Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon has long been a fortress with no team scoring there in the Champions League for 663 minutes. Last season the now Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was the reason for that but now the man keeping the clean sheets is Jan Oblak. Sportsmail looks at the 22-year-old who has made Atletico fans forget about Courtois... and David De Gea. No one knew too much about him last season outside of Portugal and Slovenia so was it a gamble? You only have to look at his price tag to see how highly-rated he was. He cost €16million (£11.5m) and that is a La Liga record for a goalkeeper. The 22-year-old was already Slovenia's number one when he left Benfica for Madrid in the summer. With experienced goalkeepers such as Petr Cech and Pepe Reina potentially available, going for a young relatively untried keeper looked a gamble but he already looks to have been money well spent. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes. Oblak gets down low to keep out a shot from Real Madrid's James Rodriguez in the second half. A success right from the start of the season?
