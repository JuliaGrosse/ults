Sharky Jama has reported been shot dead in Syria after joining Islamic State on the front lines last year. The jihadist's father had been told by Sharky's friends that the worst had happened. '[Dada] got a text message and he received a phone call from Syria, someone has told him his son has passed away,' Mr Mohamed said. 'Then he said "I tried his number", because he has contact with his son. Automatically, it goes to voicemail, that’s what he said, and then he knew that his son is gone.' The Department of Foreign Affairs was unable to confirm Sharky's death as its capacity to do so was 'extremely limited'.

'Any Australians fighting with non-state militia in Syria or Iraq should end their involvement in the conflict now and leave the conflict zone,' the spokesman
