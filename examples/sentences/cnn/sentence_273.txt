German football has certainly had better days. Still coming to terms with the morning resignation of their most gifted and charismatic coach, Jurgen Klopp, the Bundesliga then saw its champions humbled, embarrassed even, at a feverish Estadio do Dragao on Wednesday night. Not since the days of Jose Mourinho more than a decade ago have FC Porto seen anything quite like this. Porto remain one of Portugal’s eminent teams – they have been champions in three of the last four seasons – and won the Europa League four years ago. But nothing quite feels the same as bringing a genuine European superpower to its knees and Porto and their rapturous supporters went home knowing that they now have a more than a decent chance of squeezing through to the semi-finals of the Champions League when the teams reconvene in Bavaria next Tuesday. Porto earned an impressive 3-1 Champions League first leg victory against Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Wednesday night. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer brings down Porto striker Jackson Martinez to concede a third minute penalty. The Bayern players surround referee Carlos Velasco Carballo following his decision to award Porto a spot-kick. The 31-year-old forward had no problem slotting the ball past Neuer to give his side an early 1-0 advantage. German star Neuer dives in the wrong direction as Quaresma calmly slots away the spot-kick with just three minutes on the clock. Porto: Fabiano 6.
