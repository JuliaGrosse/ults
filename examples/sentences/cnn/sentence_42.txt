This is the terrifying moment that one wrong move sent a climber tumbling 10 metres down an icy cliff face. Karlis Bardelis, 30, from Latvia, was attempting to scale the cliff in Coire an Lochain, Scotland, when the accident happened. And footage from a camera mounted to his helmet shows the very second that his climbing axe came loose. Mr Berdalis said: 'I was just thinking "I hope I land somewhere soft and don't break any bones".' Scroll down for video.

Bardelis has only just released the footage of his terrifying fall on a training exercise in hospital.

Almost immediately his feet were in the air and Karlis can see nothing but his boots and the blue sky as he begins the terrifying fall down the 60m mountain. He continues to fall for three-and-a-half seconds until he's eventually saved by his safety
