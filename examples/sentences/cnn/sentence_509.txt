Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have savagely executed 10 doctors who refused to treat wounded members of the terrorist organisation. ISIS jihadis are understood to have been fighting local groups in the Hammam al-Alil area when several of them sustained injuries requiring medical treatment. When the doctors refused on the grounds they do not support the terror group's activities, the men were brutally murdered. Scroll down for video. Details of the doctors' brutal murders in the northern Iraqi desert were reported by the country's Al-Sumaria satellite television network. Local official Mowaffaq Hamid al-Azawi described the city of Mosul as a big open-air prison, where residents are subjected to barbaric torture at the hands of the ISIS terrorists. The news comes as the jihadis reportedly executed 60 Sunni tribal fighters in Iraq's Anbar province. Members of the Al-Karableh, Albu Ubaid, Albu Mahal and Albu Salman tribes were brutally executed after paranoid ISIS militants accused them of collaborating with the Iraqi security forces. Iraqi Army soldiers and the Iran-backed volunteer Shiite militias allied with the Iraqi regime have had great success in pushing ISIS out of key towns and villages recently.
