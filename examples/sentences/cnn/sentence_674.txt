A Kansas mother who uses marijuana to treat a debilitating disease is now fighting for custody of her child after the 11-year-old boy disagreed with an anti-drug presentation at his school. Shona Banda, 37, who published a book about how she uses a liquid form of cannabis as therapy for Crohn's disease, has a custody hearing Monday in Garden City, Kansas. Her boy was taken by authorities on March 24 after officials at his school reported comments he made about marijuana to child protection services. Medical marijuana activist Shona Banda, 37, is fighting for custody of her 11-year-old son after his comments about marijuana at a school presentation prompted police to search her home. The Department of Children and Families in the small Midwestern town then contacted police who went to Banda's home, according to the Garden City Telegram. She did not give authorities consent to search her home, but they returned several hours later with a warrant and discovered marijuana in plant, oil, joint, gel and capsule form along with  paraphernalia for the drug. Two ounces of cannabis in plant form and one ounce of oil were reportedly seized. Video supposedly of the incident posted on Youtube shows officers arriving at Banda's house without a warrant, standing in her backyard and refusing to let the woman enter her house for fear that she could disturb evidence. 'It is not public property, you don’t have a warrant,' Banda is heard telling the police of her backyard,
