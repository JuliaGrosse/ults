Horticulturalists have urged people to halt the 'grey sprawl' in Britain which is seeing grass and flowers in front gardens replaced by concrete. More than 7million front lawns in Britain have now been paved over - raising the risk of flooding and reducing available habitats for wildlife. And there are not just environmental consequences of replacing grass and wild flowers with brick, as the sight of a green garden is said to boost people's mood. More than 7million gardens in Britain have now been paved over and the RHS is calling for people to plant hedges, trees and flowers to turn the UK green again - as grassy well kept gardens boost mood. The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is calling on people toÂ plant trees, shrubs, climbers, hedges or flowers to attract wildlife, improve air quality and reduce urban temperatures and the risk of flooding. Alistair Griffiths, RHS director of science and collections, said: 'Many of us get a boost by simply looking at a beautiful garden or having access to green space. 'So instead of paving over green we can all play a part in reducing the grey and brightening it, and us, up with some plants. 'On top of making us feel better and happier, if hundreds and thousands of people across the country across the country grew more plants of different varieties in gardens and community spaces, it would all help to improve our air quality, benefit us, our wildlife and reduce temperatures and flooding risks.
