England must decide whether to stick with the attack that failed to force a first Test win or twist and freshen things up for a second match that is already upon them. The sight of Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood impressing in the nets here on Sunday, and Moeen Ali bowling apparently without discomfort after joining the squad, was a reminder that England have options for the second Test which starts on Tuesday. It would be harsh to blame the bowlers for their inability to take the eight wickets they needed on the final day of the Antigua Test because they threw everything at West Indies on a pitch that refused to deteriorate. Liam Plunkett, pictured with Chris Jordan, is pushing for a place in England's attack for the second Test. Mark Wood (pictured) and Plunkett impressed in the nets on Sunday ahead of the second match of the series. Yet there is no doubting that they were missing an X-factor, with strike bowlers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad down on pace and England refusing to gamble on the inconsistent leg-spin of Adil Rashid. Chris Jordan was the fastest bowler in the first Test, clocked at 91mph, and while it would be a huge surprise if England dropped either Anderson or Broad, there is a case for Plunkett or the impressive Wood to feature. ‘Over the next 12 months we are going to need a squad of bowlers who can win us Test matches,’ said vice-captain
