The parents of Elijah Cook were worried he may be born deaf. Hearing problems had run strongly through the genetics of Ahavah and Jason Cook, with both their mothers and fathers deaf. But after the baby boy was confirmed to be profoundly deaf in his left ear and only able to hear 75 decibels in his right, the couple from Andova, Minnesota, were afforded something neither of their parents were. Last month, they were able to experience the moment their son was able to hear for the first time, thanks to a pair of specially-fitted hearing aids. Amazing moment: Elijah Cook was last month fitted with hearing aids that allowed him to properly hear the voice of his mother, Ahavah Cook, for the first time. All smiles: Tests confirmed he was profoundly death in his left ear and only able to hear 75 decibels in his right, but doctors decided to fit him with hearing aids as soon as possible. What's that noise?: Elijah will now undergone a more serious set of tests in a few months, at about seven-months-old, to determine what more can be done about his hearing. Elijah failed his first hearing test just 12 hours after being born in Coon Rapids on January 2. 'When Elijah came back (from the first test), we were expecting good news because we have almost a dozen nieces and nephews that have no hearing issues,' Mrs Cook wrote on the Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota website.
