The Secret Service will have to drive Scooby One and Scooby Two back to Chappaqua without HIllary Clinton riding shotgun. Instead, she's flying coach and toting her own luggage. A United Airlines regional jet carried her back to the East Coast on Thursday from the Omaha, Nebraska airport. Her flight was bound for Newark, New Jersey, the major airport most convenient to her spacious Chappaqua, New York home. A reporter with the liberal news outlet Vox tweeted a photo of Clinton toting her own luggage on Thursday in Omaha. SHE'S JUST LIKE US? A Town Car sedan (right) met Mrs. Clinton on the tarmac in Newark on Thursday, flanked by police and Secret Service vehicles. Hillary Clinton took the fast route home from Iowa to the East Coast: just a 3-hour flight instead of 20 hours of driving time. Clinton had just finished a three-day presidential campaign swing in Council Bluffs, Iowa. That's just a few miles away, and home to a cafe where she held a top-secret meeting with Democratic Party insiders who were told to surrender their cell phones and cameras beforehand. In contrast with the private jet service Hillary has been accustomed to on her storied and lucrative speaking tours, her ride home was a no-frills commercial flight without a First Class seat to be found anywhere. For flights from Omaha to Newark, United uses Embraer ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 jets with nothing but narrow economy-class seats
