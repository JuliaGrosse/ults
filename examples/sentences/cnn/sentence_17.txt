A Celtic side with the scent of the Treble in their nostrils facing a St Mirren outfit badly in danger of entering free-fall scarcely looked like a recipe for a Friday-night thriller. And yet, for all Ronny Deila’s side prevailed in the end, this scrap provided compelling evidence that they won’t simply be given a free ride towards a fourth successive title in the coming weeks.
