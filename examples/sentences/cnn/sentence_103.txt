Point guard Stephen Curry nearly single-handedly outscored New Orleans with 11 first-quarter points as the Warriors built a 15-point lead and rolled to victory in Game One of their Western Conference first-round series. Game Two in the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Monday night in Oakland. Golden State, the top seed in the West, picked up right where it left off in the regular season, recording a 19th straight home win and 40th in 42 games this year. Stephen Curry scored a stunning 34 points for the Golden State Warriors in there play-off game. The Warriors did it by taking a 25-point lead into the final minute of the third quarter, then holding on. 'We missed a lot of free throws, which made it a lot closer than it needed to be,' coach Steve Kerr said. 'But in the playoffs you've just got to get it done somehow. We're up 1-0. That's where we want to be.' Curry led the Warriors with 34 points, hitting 13 of 25 shots and four three-pointers. All five Golden State starters scored in double figures. Guard Klay Thompson complemented Curry with 21 points, while power forward Draymond Green (15 points, 12 rebounds) and center Andrew Bogut (12 points, 14 rebounds) recorded double-doubles. The point guard has been in spectacular form as he looks to lead the Warriors to the NBA glory. Curry celebrates after scoring a three-pointer
