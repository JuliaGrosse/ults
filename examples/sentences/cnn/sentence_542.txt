Two moving candle-lit vigils have been held to remember the 900 migrants who died when their boat capsized en route to Europe from Libya this weekend. As people lay candles by the sea in Valetta, Malta, an equally emotional memorial service was taking place in front of Rome's VeranoÂ Cemetery. The deadliest migrant tragedy on the Mediterranean so far took this year's death toll on the waters to a staggering 1,800. It came as three other people - including a tiny child - died when a rickety wooden boat ran aground on the Greek island of Rhodes. And the relentless tide of migrants escaping the war-torn country of Libya has continued since the tragic wreck this weekend. The UN said that 23,500 migrants had sailed to Italy this year in addition to 12,000 who had sailed to Greece. But an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels today will announce that only 5,000 refugees who survive the perilous journey will be granted safe haven in Europe and the rest will be sent back, the Guardian has reported.
