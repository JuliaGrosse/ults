Three people have been sent to prison and another two are awaiting sentencing for their roles in a horrific assault on a 53-year-old man, who was beaten, tied to a chair,  and covered in offensive tattoos. A Philadelphia court heard Thursday that Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, was the ringleader of the gang, who have become known as the 'tattoo terrorists'. Campbell believed the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat, Pebbles. Valecce, an unemployed drug addict, had been staying in the basement of Campbell's mother's house in Mayfair, in the city's northeast, however that basement would become a torture chamber where he would be strapped to a chair and violated for three days.

Accomplices: Sandra Ng, 19 (left), Campbell's girlfriend, was sentenced to 23 months in state prison for her role in the shocking assault last year, while another defendant Jennifer Pratt, 40, is awaiting trial. Campbell apparently discovered that Pebbles had suffered a broken leg and had reason to believe Valecce was responsible. The incident occurred in late March 2014, according to Philly.com.
