Shane Warne hailed Richie Benaud as the 'godfather of cricket' following the former Australia captain and broadcaster's death at the age of 84. Benaud was as well known for his commentary as his cricket after moving into a career in the media in 1956 which saw him become the voice of the game in both England and his homeland. But he was also a trailblazing all-rounder who took 228 wickets and scored 2,201 runs in 68 Tests while never losing a series in charge of his country. Tributes are seen at the statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84. A tribute of a microphone with Benaud's Test cap number of 190 is left at the statue. The flags atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge can be seen flying at half-mast as a tribute to Benaud. The Australian flag at the SCG is lowered at half mast for the Australian cricketer and commentator. One of Benaud's most famous commentaries was on the 'ball of the century' - Warne's first delivery in Ashes cricket which dismissed Mike Gatting - and the 45-year-old fellow leg-spinner paid an emotional tribute to his mentor on Instagram. 'Dear Richie,' he wrote. 'I've known you & Daphne for close to 30 years & to everyone you were a legend on all levels & rightly so too. As a cricketer, commentator & as a person, you were the best there's ever
