Cuts and wounds in the skin heal in much the same way as a zip being fastened, new microscopic images have revealed. Biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself. They found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip. This image on the left taken of skin cells healing a wound using an electron microscope show how cells on opposing sides (coloured green and brown) interlock together in a similar way to a zipper used on clothes. The image on the right shows how the would looks on the surface at this stage in the healing process. The researchers hope their findings could help in the development of new treatments for wounds that could speed up this process. Dr Mikhail Eltsov, one of the scientists behind the study at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, said: 'When we look at it from a distance, it appears as if skin cells simply fuse to each other, but if we zoom in, it becomes clear that membranes, molecular machines, and other cellular components are involved. 'Our electron microscope allows us to distinguish the molecular components in the cell that act like small machines to fuse the skin. 'In order to visualize this orchestra of healing, a very high-resolution picture of the process is needed. 'For this purpose we have recorded an enormous amount of data that surpasses all previous studies of this kind.' Dr Eltsov
