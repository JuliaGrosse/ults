Chelsea were made to work hard for their three points against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Eden Hazard starred for Jose Mourinho's team. He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before Charlie Adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time. Stoke continued to make things difficult for Chelsea until an Asmir Begovic error led to Loic Remy tapping in the winner. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill gives his player ratings. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Thibaut Courtois – 5.5. Never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by Adam with an incredible strike from inside Stoke’s half. Too far off his line and one of the world’s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed. Thibaut Courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget  Charlie Adam beating him from his own half. Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid. Branislav Ivanovic – 6.5. Tidied up well on the rare occasion Stoke threatened. Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill – 6.5. Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry – 7. Manned
