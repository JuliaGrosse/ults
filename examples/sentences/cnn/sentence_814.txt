A Perth woman who claimed she cured her cancer using a dietary program where she ate vast amounts of pineapple has pledged to release her medical records after critics questioned claims about her'magic diet'. In the wake of recent controversy surrounding 'wellness warriors' such as Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson and the death of Gerson Therapy advocate Jessica Ainscough, bloggers have demanded 'irrefutable proof' that modelling agent Candice-Marie Fox cured her cancer 'with juice'. Ms Fox said she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2011. She initially had surgery to remove tumours from her neck that September and she then underwent a course of radiation treatment to'mop up' the cancer in December. But when a return visit to the doctors revealed cancer cells had spread to other parts of her body, Ms Fox rejected further conventional medical treatment in favour of a diet and lifestyle plan she discovered online.

Juice in hand: Candice-Marie Fox (pictured) claims to have cured her cancer with a nutritional program involving the heavy consumption of pineapples. Ms Fox underwent surgery and radiation treatment. She is planning to release relevant medical records without her personal details. 'I was feeling a bit lost, just winging it on the internet myself,' she said, until she discovered a U.S. organisation called the Nutritional Oncology Research Institute.
