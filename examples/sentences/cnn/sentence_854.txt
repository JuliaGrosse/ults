In Afghanistan, many girls are forbidden from riding bicycles - they are, however, allowed to ride skateboards. So when Australian skateboarder Oliver Percovich created Skateistan, a non-profit organization that aims to connect youth in Afghanistan with education through skateboarding, it shouldn't have been a surprise that 40 per cent of the program's students would be girls. In 2012, photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson decided to take pictures of these Middle Eastern skater girls, and her work was recently on display at a gallery in London. Scroll down for video. Tough girls: Photographer Jessica Fulford-Dobson took pictures of young girls skateboarding in dresses and skirts in Kabul, Afghanistan. Finding time for fun: Most girls are not allowed to ride bikes in Afghanistan, but skateboarding isn't against the rules. According to Feature Shoot, when Mr. Percovich first brought the program to Kabul, Afghanistan in 2007, many of the locals had never even heard of skateboarding. In fact, Ms. Fulford-Dobson said she believes the reason skateboarding has been received so differently in Afghanistan than in other countries is precisely because it was new to the region. 'When skateboarding arrived in Afghanistan, it didn't have any preconceived images for them. They didn't know what it was,' she said, while adding that it was only accepted after it became clear that it was just 'a toy to have fun with'. Safety
