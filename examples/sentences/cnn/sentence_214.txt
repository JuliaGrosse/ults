Qatar have unveiled the design for their fifth World Cup stadium, a 40,000-seater ground built in 'the gateway to the desert' and featuring air conditioning for the comfort of players and fans. The Al Rayyan Stadium is inspired by sand dunes and its design has been produced by UK-based architecture firms Ramboll and Pattern. Fans in the stands will sit in a comfortable 24-28 degrees Celsius, while paths and walkways leading to the stadium will also be cooled. Qatar have unveiled the design for their fifth World Cup stadium, the 40,000-seater Al Rayyan Stadium. The Al Rayyan Stadium is inspired by sand dunes and its design has been produced by UK-based firms. The stadium is expected to host matches up to the quarter-final stage of the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Al Rayyan will hold matches up to the quarter-final stage of the 2022 tournament and after the World Cup its capacity will be almost halved to 21,000 seats, with the removable upper tier sent to developing nations. The new stadium, set to be completed in the early months of 2019, now has a more traditional look than the previously-mooted design which featured a huge screen referred to as a 'digital skin'. Sitting on the site of a now-deconstructed ground, Al Rayyan's facade includes seven patterns representing different aspects of Qatari culture which designers say 'blend together to tell the story of a nation'.
