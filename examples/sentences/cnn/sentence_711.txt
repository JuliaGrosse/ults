Unleashing your inner Shakespeare could be just a few jolts of electricity away. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current on the brain's of 20 volunteers to stimulate the brain's natural alpha wave oscillations. Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent. As well as creativity, these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression. Flavio Frohlich, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina said: 'If we could enhance these brain activity patterns, then we could potentially help many people.' Alpha oscillations occur within the frequency range of eight and 12 Hertz 9 (or cycles per second). They were discovered in 1929 by Hans Berger, who invented EEG. Alpha oscillations happen most prominently when we close our eyes and shut out sensory stimuli â€“ things we see, feel, taste, smell, and hear. When alpha oscillations are active, your sensory inputs might be offline as you daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas. When you come fully online, alpha oscillations disappear. Other oscillations at higher frequencies, such as gamma oscillations, take over. An EEG of a naturally occurring alpha oscillation in a human brain. Enhancing these electric oscillations may help treat people with depression, scientists claim.
