'Exploited by criminals': Gambian footballer Baboucarr Ceesay (above) was among the 900 migrants who died in the Mediterranean boat disaster, his British aunt has revealed. A British woman has revealed how her nephew was among the 900 migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean boat disaster. Baboucarr Ceesay, a talented footballer from The Gambia, is believed to have died on the fishing boat in a 'desperate' attempt to seek a new life in the UK. His aunt Jessica Sey, from Cheltenham, has spoken of her devastation after discovering that he was not among the 27 survivors and demanded the human traffickers be brought to justice. She said: 'He had his head turned and his money taken by criminals who are responsible for thousands of deaths.Â It's the biggest shock of my life. 'His mother will never get his body back. She'll never be able to ask him why he did it.' She said her two daughters were 'absolutely gobsmacked' by news of the 21-year-old's death. Mrs Sey and her Gambian-born husband lived in the west African country for around five years. She said her nephew played first division football in The Gambia, was the eldest of four siblings and appeared to enjoy a comfortable life. She told the Gloucestershire Echo: 'His mother, Jabou, has lost two husbands and had a really tough time through no fault of her own. '
