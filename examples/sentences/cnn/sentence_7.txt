Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, died after he and a colleague got into difficulties battling a fire started at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter on July 13, 2013. A 16-year-old girl charged with arson after she discarded a cigarette causing a city centre shop blaze which claimed the life of a firefighter had the charge dropped today after a judge said she was 'guilty only of being careless'. Fireman Stephen Hunt, 38, lost his life tackling the inferno which began at Paul's Hair World in Manchester's Northern Quarter almost two years ago. The girl - who was just 15 at the time - is said to have dropped a cigarette to the floor while standing near the shop's fire exit which rolled underneath the door and set boxes alight. She was originally charged with arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, but was cleared having been due to stand trial on Monday. After more than a year of legal wrangling, with scientists initially stating that the fire could not have been started accidentally, further investigation led to the conclusion a discarded cigarette could have been the cause. More than 60 firefighters battled the blaze, which erupted on July 13, 2013, as frightened passers-by watched on. Father-of-two Mr Hunt, of Whitefield, Manchester, and another fireman, got into difficulties while tackling the fire and they were rushed to hospital where Mr Hunt was pronounced dead.
