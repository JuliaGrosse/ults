If you think you have seen a ghost, you may have been suffering the effects of exposure to mould, according to a group of scientists. Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains. Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment. All an illusion? Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings (illustrated by a stock image) are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains. ‘Experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds,’ said Professor Shane Rogers of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. ‘Psychoactive effects of some fungi are well-known, whereas the effects of others such as indoor moulds are less researched. ‘Although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established, there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other functioning of the brain. ‘Reports of psychiatric symptoms including mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment are prevalent among those exposed to moulds. Brain drain: Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment, among other problems. A stock image of toxic mould in the firm of Stachybotrys chartarum spores, is shown. 'Ghosts' tend
