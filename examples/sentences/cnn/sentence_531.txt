The records are tumbling and Leicester’s belief is growing. Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win. Scoring surge. Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium. Cambiasso class.
