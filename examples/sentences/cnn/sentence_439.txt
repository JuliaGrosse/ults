Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-oldÂ Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez.
