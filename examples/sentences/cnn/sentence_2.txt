Accused: Retired general Sir Frank Kitson (above) won a CBE for his service in the Army. A retired general is being sued over a murder in Northern Ireland more than 40 years ago. Sir Frank Kitson, who is 88, is accused in the case of Patrick Eugene Heenan, a Catholic killed by loyalists in 1973. It is the first time a retired senior officer has been personally sued over the Troubles. Yesterday however, Sir Frank said he was confused as to why he was being named because he was not even serving in Northern Ireland at the time. He learned of the legal action in a letter from a Belfast law firm at the weekend. Mr Heenan, 47, was killed when paramilitaries threw a grenade at a minibus carrying him and 14 others to a Belfast building site. His widow, Mary, is suing the Ministry of Defence and the general, claiming he died because of ‘negligence and misfeasance’. But Sir Frank told the Daily Mail he had no connection to the case. ‘I wasn’t even there in 1973,’ he said. ‘I was in Ireland from September 1970 until April 1972. I know nothing about what happened to Mr Heenan. 'I wasn’t a policy maker, I was a commander of troops. I have absolutely no knowledge of Mr Heenan and I had gone from Ireland at the time of his death.’
