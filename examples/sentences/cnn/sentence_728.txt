But that irritating nocturnal drone might actually be an early warning sign of dementia, scientists have warned. Researchers have discovered that people who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions. In a worrying study, they found that people with sleep apnoea - a condition often typified by heavy snoring - saw a mental decline more than a decade earlier, on average, than those who had no sleep problems. People who have breathing problems while asleep are more likely to experience an early decline in memory and other brain functions. The US researchers’ results also suggested that the onset of Alzheimer’s might be accelerated among those with sleeping problems. At least half a million Britons suffer from sleep apnoea, which is most often found in middle-aged, overweight men. The condition causes the muscles in the airway to contract during sleep, which cuts off the air supply, usually resulting in a heavy snore. It causes disrupted sleep and daytime exhaustion, pushing up blood pressure. Study author Dr Ricardo Osorio, of New York University, said: ‘Abnormal breathing patterns during sleep such as heavy snoring and sleep apnoea are common in the elderly.’ The research team studied the medical histories of 2,470 people, aged 55 to 90.
