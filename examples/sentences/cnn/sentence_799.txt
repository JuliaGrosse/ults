The 79th Masters gets underway on Thursday and the focus will be on Rory McIlroy as the Northern Irishman bids to become only the sixth man in history to claim the career Grand Slam. But Tiger Woods, returning to competitive action for the first time since February and battling a succession of injuries and the chipping yips, will once again come under the microscope as he bids for a fifth green jacket and 15th major. Bubba Watson is the defending champion in a field that also includes young American stars Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler, plus a host of former champions, including Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott. European stalwarts Justin Rose, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Henrik Stenson will fancy their chances, while old Ryder Cup foes such as Dustin Johnson and Jim Furyk are also gunning for glory. Here is the complete list of tee times for rounds one and two. Tiger Woods returns to action when the year's first major gets under way at Augusta National. Round 1. Group 1, 7:45am: Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman. Group 2, 7:56am: Larry Mize, Danny Willett, Byron Meth. Group 3, 8:07am: Tom Watson, Gary Woodland, Camilo Villegas.
