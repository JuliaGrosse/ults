Michael Buckley, 60, from Forest Hill, south east London, died after being hit by a shopping trolley as he bought festive groceries at Marks & Spencer. A shopper caused the death of a frail widower by 'deliberately ramming' him with her trolley, a court heard yesterday. Melanie Buck is said to have become frustrated because the food aisles in Marks & Spencer were gridlocked by Christmas shoppers. When she could not get past 60-year-old Michael Buckley she exchanged heated words with him before knocking him over with her trolley, it was alleged. Mr Buckley – who suffered from diabetes and weighed only 8st – fell to the floor in the M&S aisle and broke his thighbone and wrist. When a shop assistant rushed to help him, he allegedly told her: 'She rammed me.' The following day, an operation under general anaesthetic to repair 5ft 5in Mr Buckley's injuries appeared to go well. But on Christmas Day his condition worsened after he suffered what doctors believe was a heart attack. He was taken into intensive care and put on a life- support machine. Two months later, the decision was taken to turn off the machine and he was pronounced dead. Prosecuting at Croydon Crown Court yesterday, David Howker QC said Miss Buck, 33, was out shopping with her mother on December 22, 2012. She arrived at the store in The Glades shopping centre, in Bromley, south-east London,
