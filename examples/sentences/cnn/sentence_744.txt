Women are undervaluing themselves and asking for less pay than they should – widening the gender pay gap, it is claimed. Research found that women applying for jobs through recruitment agencies remain coy about asking for asking a decent wage package. A study found women routinely ask for £4,000 less for a typical job, but that this widens to up to £10,000 less in more senior industries such as accountancy. Gender gap widening: A study found women routinely ask for £4,000 less for a typical job, but that this widens to up to £10,000 less in more senior industries such as accountancy. On average, women ask for almost a fifth less than men, rising to nearly a third less in some financial sectors. Not only do they ask for less than their male colleagues, but they are also asking for below what they could typically expect to earn in their industry. New research from Reed.co.uk found that female applicants state their ‘anticipated salary’ as £19,900, on average, while men asked for £23,800. Expected salaries varied by industry with women asking for 29 per cent less than men in accountancy, 22 per cent less in banking, 21 per cent less in the energy sector and 18 per cent lower in education.
