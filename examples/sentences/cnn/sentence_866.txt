A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being 'heartless' in court on Wednesday by angry family members. Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday. Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons.

I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported
