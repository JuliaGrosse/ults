It looks like a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft, but these strange vehicles are actually new new type of aircraft developed in China. Two prototypes of the CYG-11 seaplane were tested this week over the sea off the coast of Haikou in Hainan Province in China. The aircraft is believed to be a joint project between Russia and China to build new types of super-efficient seaplane. The CYG-11 seaplane (above) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing-in-ground effect to glide. The vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing-in-ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft's wings are close to the ground. Length: 13m. Wingspan: 15.6 m. Weight: 3800 kg. Seats: 12 people. Maximum load: 1200 kg. Maximum range: 1500 km. Flight speed: 175 - 250 km/h. Flight height: 3-5 m. Wave height: 1.25 - 3 m. By placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft, this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air. Engineers behind the CNY 5 billion (Â£500 million) project say the aircraft are capable of flying 62 miles (100 km) on 28 litres of fuel. With a maximum range of 930 miles (1,500 km), the aircraft can reach a top speed of
