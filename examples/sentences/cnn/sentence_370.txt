The Australian Government has won its bid to ban theÂ boss of the nation's biggest bikie gang from Australia after the Federal Court ruled unanimously against Alex Vella re-entering the country. Three Federal Court judges ruled that Vella, 61 - who is regularly described as a millionaire businessman - be prohibited from returning after the government cancelled the Rebels bikie gang president's visa while he was overseas in his native Malta last year. In a judgement obtained by Daily Mail Australia, the court this week ordered Vella, who has painted himself as a Nelson Mandela-like figure and sold stubby holders and t-shirts to fund his legal battle, pay all court costs. The decision strands Vella in Malta, leaving behind in Australia 24 close family members including a wife, sons and an elderly mother, all of whom are Australian citizens. Known as 'the Maltese Falcon', Vella is the longtime boss of the Rebels, which Federal Court documents obtained by Daily Mail Australia say are involved in drug dealing, money laundering, serious assaults, kidnapping, extortion, firearms offences, threatening law enforcement officers and intimidating court witnesses.
