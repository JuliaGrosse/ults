Getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art, but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar. Economists plotted how much goods listed on eBay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers, such as $1,000. In fact, sellers who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices. US researchers claim that exact prices of goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers. This chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number (the red dots), like $1,000, the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number (the blue circles), like $1,079. In terms of the study, the word 'odd' is used to represent an unusual number, and not the opposite of even. Competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go, but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits, Professor of Strategic Management at University of Toronto, Joshua Gans, writes for The Conversation. Within that range, sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one, so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator. Sometimes, however, sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough, such
