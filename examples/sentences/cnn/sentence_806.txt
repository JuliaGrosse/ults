Jack Black the friendly jackdaw (pictured) has become so well-loved one fan has set up a Facebook page for him with over 450 members. As a popular member of the community he often pops into people’s houses, goes with them on the weekly shop and has even joined them for Christmas dinner. He’ll also accompany the local children as they walk to school – perched on their shoulders. He is Jack Black the friendly jackdaw and he has become so well-loved in Penryn, Cornwall, that one fan has set up a Facebook page for him. The page has more than 450 members who share their pictures, videos and stories about Jack and keep up to date with his daily activities. Jack was hand-reared by a vet as a chick in 2013 after being discovered with no feathers, before being released into the wild. He then started popping into homes and gardens but has since broadened his network to a ten-mile radius, visiting houses and flats and even college and university campuses, offices, schools and sports clubs. He has become so relaxed around humans that he regularly falls asleep in the laps and hands of residents. He taps on windows to signal he has arrived and even pops into supermarkets and perches on trolleys as residents shop. Locals, who keep bird food and treats in their homes, are able to distinguish him from other jackdaws because of a silver tag tied to his right leg. Grace Chapman-Duke
