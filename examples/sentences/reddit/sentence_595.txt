TITLE: I [18F] can't shake off the feeling that my boyfriend [21M] is sick of me/doesn't love me anymore.
POST: We've been together for almost half a year. I am constantly worrying that he doesn't love me anymore even though he says he does. The smallest things will make me upset. For example, if I notice that he isn't saying "I love you" as often as he normally does, or if he doesn't want to spend as much time with me... I assume that he's sick of me. And I feel like it is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think this may just be a case of my own emotional immaturity, and not a sign of an actual problem in our relationship. I worry that the fact that I need constant reassurance that he still loves me is what will drive him away. How can I get out of this mindset?
TL;DR:
