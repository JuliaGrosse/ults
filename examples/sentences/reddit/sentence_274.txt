TITLE: Am I (27F) a dick to kick out my roommate? (28F)
POST: hello everyone!

so i have lived at my 3 bedroom place for 4 years, cycling through different roomies every year. Im a little tired of living with 2 other people and am considering splitting this place with just one of my current roommates whom i get along with really well. I have looked into moving and i cant find anything with as good a deal as my current place. I also plan on getting a dog soon and it's very hard to find a place that allows that, mine currently does.

anyway, my other roommate isn't a bad person but i just really don't want to live with her again. she has a little OCD in her, needing things to be a certain way and often moving my things around without telling me. she's also lost/broken some of my stuff without telling me either. I've talked to her about it and its gotten better but i still just find her presence very annoying and i dont want to live with her another year. Its not just the behaviors, its her as a person.

my question is, do i have the right to "kick her out?" Part of me feels like I do, since I have been here 4 years, all the furniture/dishes/cookware/everything is mine, and I am currently the leaseholder. On the other hand, if shes been paying rent this whole year, i guess she has the right to stay if she wants regardless of what i want.

Thoughts? Whats the best way to approach this with her?
TL;DR:
