TITLE: I [18M] still have an uneasy bad feeling after an argument with my [18F] girlfriend of 4 months, even though we are both over the argument now
POST: So me and my Girlfriend got in an argument Thursday night, that caused a lot of bickering and arguments over the entire weekend. It wasn't over anything major and the argument is over now and were fine now.

She's the most caring, affectionate partner I'v ever had and I love her so when she went cold on me throughout the weekend as well as us having been argumentative with each other, which we never are It was slightly shocking

Even though I'm not mad at her anymore and we'v both apologized and forgave each other I'm still kinda raw after it all

It's like I have tunnel vision and can only concentrate on what happened.

I don't think I should tell my girlfriend I'm still raw after it all because when we bring up what happened it really brings the mood down.

She's back to her amazing affectionate self now and I'm being very positive to her so do I just need time? 

This is my first relationship and first argument that lasted more than a day so is this normal?
TL;DR:
