TITLE: My girlfriend 19f and myself 19m have been dating for over a year now and still fight all the time, I am not sure what to do. (tough situation)
POST: My girlfriend 19f and myself 19m have been dating for about a year and a half now. To try and make a long story short, her parents got divorced right after we met and got together so I am her only "go to/family" because her relationship with them has been destroyed and the parents treat her horribly now. We are both in college and do not have similar attitudes and most of our hobbies are very different. She does not get along with others very well but I can make friends with a bug. I am the dominant one in the relationship and she has been the dominant one in her past relationships so this causes problems between both of us as I'm sure you can imagine. For months now we have been fighting more than ever and it all seems to come from me not spending the amount of time she wants me to spend with her, but even when I do this we (mostly me) are only happy for a few weeks and then this process repeats. Another thing I would like to mention is that I am very focused on my future and career and I spend most of my time working, studying, taking care of any leadership positions I have, and working out. Those are my passions and I feel like it would be selfish of me not to take advantage of all the opportunities I have been given.  This relationship is very unhealthy for the both of us and I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions or advice? Please help all suggestions are welcome.
