SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I'm [18/F] concerned with my boyfriends [19/M] plans for the future.
POST: Okay, so to begin with my boyfriend and I have been together for a year now. We met in highschool and were close friends, and then began a relationship once he graduated. I'm still in my final year. 

Okay, so when he finished he was really unsure what to choose, but ended up choosing a film school in the city, which I thought up until now he was enjoying. Last night he couldn't sleep and told me he was really hating it and was unsure what he wanted to do with his life. 

As a back story, my boyfriend has depression. He plays a lot of video games, and when he sees his friends (who don't go to college or have jobs), they play games too. Now, I don't have a problem with this, I too play games, sometimes with him as well. I don't mind this hobby he has, but sometimes it feels like it takes priority over school. 

We talked through it last night and I told him I would support him 100%, no matter what he decides. He sais the idea of maybe doing IT would interest him, and I said that sounds like a great idea. He plans on talking to his family about it, so he can have their opinion. 

Now, I know in my heart I will support him no matter what, but I'm worried. He doesn't really have anything he's super passionate about, and I'm a very driven person. I plan on going to university to study business, with aspirations to open my own shop front. He doesn't have this drive - but I believe he has the potential to. 

What I'm asking now, is what do you guys think about the video game situation? Should I talk to him about it? Also, do you have any advice on how to help him choose something, or guide him in the right direction? I really love him and want to support him through this.
TL;DR:
