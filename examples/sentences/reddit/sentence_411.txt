TITLE: Can I [20f] confront my boyfriend [20m] about stuff I found while snooping?
POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 months. For the last month or so, he had been constantly accusing me of cheating on him. I had to fend off accusations every day basically, despite not cheating on him, and not doing anything out of line that might make him suspicious. He just said he had a "hunch". Cheating and trust had been a non-issue until then, so I thought it was weird he brought it up so much but did my best to reassure him.

That seemed to die off a few weeks ago, and we've been great ever since, but a few days ago something irked me. I asked him to list me as his girlfriend on Facebook, and he didn't want to. I don't like to really conduct my personal life online so I didn't push it. Later on, he left for work and wanted to log onto my Facebook to kill some time, and his profile came up. I know I shouldn't have looked, but curiosity got the better of me.

I found messages through the last two months of our relationship of him making plans to smoke joints with a few girls, take another out for a beer, and he messaged another calling her "absolutely gorgeous". He also had his ex-girlfriends page bookmarked. There is no hard evidence of him cheating, but this sure looks suspicious and makes me uncomfortable. Can I confront him?
TL;DR:
