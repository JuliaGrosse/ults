TITLE: [21/m] Don't know how to rid of cheating GF [21/f]
POST: Hello everyone, I will try to keep this short and sweet. I have been friends with her since 7th grade. We started dating each other since we were both 16, Juniors in High School. Everything was good, our families got a long well as did we. We went to the same college and it was an adjustment but still good. The middle of last year, though, we both got very busy. She was working 40+ hours a week and going to school full time, so we had almost no time to see each other. I had felt like I had to keep everyday open and not commit to anything else just in case she had an opening. 

Around last summer I started to get severe clinical depression and am still suffering. We saw each other less and less but talked daily. When we did see each other she was constantly on her phone and enjoying that more than my presence. Eventually last November I found out that she had been seeing another coworker, and spending all her free time with him (which I thought she didn't have). 

Since then, It has constantly been back and forth. I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt but I truly don't want anything to do with her. We still are keeping in contact and I tried to keep it as just friends but she constantly wants more and is blaming me for everything wrong. Now I know what you will say, just get rid of her. And thats what I've been trying to do because I can't have a relationship with someone who does that. She constantly is trying to stay with me by saying she is the only one I have to talk to so who else would I go to. What is the best way to get rid of her although our families are still close?

THANK YOU!
