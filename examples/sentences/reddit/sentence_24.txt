TITLE: Looking for advice on how I [16M] could get my crush/friend/prom date [17F] to actually like me/want to date me.
POST: So I've liked this girl for quite some time (~1 year) and only recently decided to do anything about it. I got her number, we started talking/texting a lot, and finally, since the timing worked out, I decided to ask her to prom. She says yes, everything is going well, and we even decide to go out on a date (at least, I would call it a date) before the dance, and after that she even suggests we do it again if there's time. 

Yesterday I decided to propose the idea of dating after prom. She tells me that she isn't really interested in me like that, likes me as a friend, yadda, yadda, yadda, you know the story. The "friendzone" as it is not-so-affectionately named. 

Any advice on what I should do from here? The dance is coming up on Friday, so any advice relevant to that would be great, but I'd appreciate general advice as well.
TL;DR:
