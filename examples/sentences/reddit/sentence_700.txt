TITLE: LDR question - How often should you stay home to talk to your SO?
POST: Hi Reddit,

I'm a 20F who's been dating a 21M for over a year.

My boyfriend and I are currently in a quasi-long-distance relationship. We live relatively near each other, but my parents are unsupportive of the relationship (for various reasons)… So the time we can spend together is extremely limited. In fact, the majority of the time we "spend together" is online, like most LDR couples.

Let me start off by saying that I'm extremely supportive of my boyfriend spending time with his friends. I've learned over the years that time apart is necessary for a happy, healthy relationship. When he tells me he's going out and getting offline, I'm all smiles, and I send him off with a big "Hope you have fun tonight!" I'm all for independence, I really am. I'm not one of those girlfriends who expects their boyfriend to drop everything they're doing to come talk to me.

But the thing is, he goes out every single night…without fail. He's gone from around dinner time to 3-4AM. He sleeps all day, wakes up at around 4-5PM, we talk or hang out (if possible) for around an hour, and then he leaves again to go out with friends. 

Every time I try talking about it, he gets extremely riled up. So I just ended up giving up on discussing the issue. But yeah, the other day, when I had a horrible, horrible day and wanted to talk to him for a while, I just acted a little sad that he was leaving, and even then he started getting angry. 

I presume that this is an issue that at least some LDR couples go through. Is this something that I simply have to get over? Am I acting selfish / spoiled for wanting him to stay in once in a while?
TL;DR:
