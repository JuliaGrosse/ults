TITLE: Me (19m) thinking about breaking up with my SO (18 f) of 2.5 yrs - Is it supposed to be this hard?
POST: I'll start this by giving a brief history of our relationship. This was the first major relationship for both of us. We were eachother's first for everything, from kissing to losing our virginities to each other. We have been together since our sophomore year of highschool, and are now both at college, 5 1/2 hours away from eachother. 
Over the summer, we hit a really rough patch. I had been having doubts about our relationship for a few weeks, and when I brought them up to her, it spiraled out of control and we almost ended the relationship. Most of my doubts centered around my worries that we weren't right for eachother. We have little in common, and it seems like a lot of the time she tolerates things I do or like rather than enjoy them.

However, things got better and we went into this year feeling fairly confident about our status. But now that I'm away, the old doubts are returning and I can't shake them. I graduated in a class of 56 kids and am now in a major university with over 25,000 students. Being here has kind of opened my eyes in a lot of ways. Honestly, I just don't see a future in our relationship anymore. I sat down the other day and wrote a list of all the qualities I would want in a potential SO, and while my girlfriend is a great person, she doesn't really show almost any of those qualities.

Basically, intellectually, I feel like breaking up is the right move. Even if I was sure about us, the distance would be a huge struggle. But the thing is, whenever I think about what I would have to say, I don't know if I can do it. It hurts to think about breaking up with this girl I have share so much with and been through so much together with. So my question is - is this normal? If anyone has been through a similar situation, or wants to offer any advice at all I would appreciate feedback.
TL;DR:
