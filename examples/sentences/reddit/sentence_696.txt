TITLE: Class 1 Misdemeanor trespassing in VA for entering a building under construction to take pictures, photographic defense against?
POST: Hey there, I'm a college kid in DC with an interest in photography. A few weeks back, I entered an unfinished 35 story building with a friend to take pictures of the view. 

We were walking in the city with our cameras and I found a wide open entrance to the building site (completely illuminated at 12:30 am). We were under the influence of no alcohol or drugs, we didn't take anything (besides pictures) and we didn't leave anything. There were no posted trespassing signs, no security guards and no cameras. 

I stupidly published a blog with pictures from the evening and a sensationalized account of the evening. The company head of security found it and has brought us up on VA 18.2-119 for trespassing. 

The writing of the law on the warrant states that a person is prohibited from entering a site based on posted signage by an authorized individual forbidding such actions. Fortunately, I took pictures before the incident and three days after (when we were contacted about the incident). The pictures clearly show a wide opening and no posted signs at the end of a busy metro stop. Three days later, there is a large additional fence blocking the entrance, caution tape covering the entrance to the building and an "Authorized Personel Only" sign. I can timestamp these photos.
TL;DR:
