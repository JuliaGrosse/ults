SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [38 M]. Are these thoughts mature or stupid?
POST: I've been dating a woman 10 years my junior. She's sweet and fun and she likes me. But I'm not *crazy* about her, in that I don't daydream about her, want to tear off her clothes, etc. Let's call her "Daisy". 

Yesterday I met someone who instantly grabbed my attention. I'm drawn to her, curious about her, and feel unsafe, unsure, and unsettled. We texted briefly, I'm awaiting a response, and I've spent the past 12 hours anxious that I've already been too eager. Let's call her "Violet".

I felt the same way about an on-again, off-again, ex-girlfriend. She was SO hot, so interesting, but was never completely available. She would periodically disappear and hurt me in the process. Let's call her "Lisa".

(N.B. the two even look the same; if I have a physical *type*, they're it.)

To the question...

I'm getting older and want to get married someday. I presume that infatuations with women like Violet and Lisa - ones who immediately grab my attention but with whom I feel no sense of safety - could only stand in my way of a long-term, mutually supportive, adult relationship.

So married Redditors, or Redditors with LTR's, please share your wisdom:

Whether or not Daisy is the right choice, should I give the benefit of the doubt to the women who seem less "exciting" but who also seem more available? Have any of you regretted making a similar choice: discounting the ones who excite you the most, while building relationships with the more available people who don't? Did you ever feel - and regret - as if you might have "settled"?
TL;DR:
