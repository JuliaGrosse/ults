TITLE: Socially awkward here. When can I [18M] kiss her [18F]?
POST: So this girl and I were set up by our older sisters. We go to different schools and live about 30 mins away from each other.

We've gone on a few dates. I hug her before and after each date. We haven't held hands or kissed yet but I want to. Obviously she likes me since she asked her sister to set her up with me. She is waiting for me to ask her to prom and has asked her sister frequently about how I plan to do it (her sister knows since she is friends with my older sister, who I have told the plan to). I'm asking her to prom this week on our next date with this super clever "activity" of which she has no clue.

Anyways, I want to kiss her this date and hold her hand. It's gonna be about a 1 hour date and 1 hour drive time together. I'm sure that my cleverness will blow her mind. Would this be a good time to kiss her? I am planning on holding her hand walking from the car and would feel comfortable doing so. Any advice would be appreciated!
