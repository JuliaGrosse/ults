TITLE: My bf (24) Doesn't Feel the same anymore and asked for a break...
POST: M(24) F (24) Boyfriend of 2 years wants a break because we have been arguing a lot... he said he doesn't want to feel tired anymore and that he just doesn't feel the same anymore.. that hopefully with this break and us working on our issues separately he can feel un-tired and choose if he wants to be with me or not.. I tried breaking up with him because I didn't think I could handle a break he said only do it if that's what my heart wants and what would make me happy.. that what he wants is time to determine our relationship.. how should I feel? is this relationship even salvageable at this point? should I go no contact until he decides?
TL;DR:
