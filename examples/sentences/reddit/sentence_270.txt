TITLE: Reddit, whats the weirdest/creepiest thing that ever happened to you following a break up?
POST: I'll go first.
So I'm going out with this girl for about a year and a half, it started off as just fooling around but things got pretty serious fast. Fast forward about two months ago and one of my close friends tell me that he seen her out with some guy at the cinema, at first I thought it couldn't of been her because she had told me that she was spending the week at her moms the night my friend saw her. I try texting and calling her all week but doesn't answer any of it.
When she gets back I immediately ask her was she cheating on me. Not the best approach I know but I was frustrated as hell. She starts bursting into tears and tells me its all true and that she spent the week at this guys place, so i do what any normal man would do in that situation and I lose my shit. We argue for what must have been an hour and we end up breaking up. I clearly remember calling her a whore when she was walking out the door, not my most mature moment.

This is when it gets weird, about two weeks ago I get a text saying 'You're dead' off an unknown number. I ignore it and then just two or three days after that I'm out with friends, just hanging out and this random guy comes up to us from across the road and punches me in the face. Now I'm kind of a small guy so I drop like a ton of bricks. As the guys runs away he yells back 'Thats for calling my girlfriend a whore'. Turns out my ex got with the guy she was cheating with me with and told him what i called and her. I rang my ex asking for an explanation and she told me 'Thats what you get for messing with his girl'.

So Reddit now its your turn.
