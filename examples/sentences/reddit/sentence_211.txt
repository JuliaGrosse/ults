TITLE: After A Parent Dies - Help and advice for a non-parent who's parenting
POST: In July my best friend died, leaving behind her twin 10 year old girls and her grieving husband. We were more than best friends. She was basically my wife for 18 years. 

In the aftermath of her sudden and unexpected death, my husband and I have upped our involvement with the children. We are their guardians, should anything happen with their Dad and are now taking them on some weekends to give him some time to adult. My friend's mother also moved into the house to help, but she is older and hasn't been a teenage (or preteen) in sometime. Neither her nor her husband know how to "girl" and as a result, I can see trouble brewing... 

Husband and I do not have children (this was actually a year we were ttc but with all the stress?) and while I have plenty of experience babysitting, actually parenting? Completely foreign. We've been seeing ourselves as cool Aunt/Uncle but we realize that as time goes on we're entering into parenting zone.

I do recognize too, that I will be the one who is the role model / confident / guiding force during the adolescent/teen years... To do that without screwing them up I feel like I should study up.

Then there is the fact that they are grieving and I'd probably feel better if I understood how the child brain deals with such a trauma. What things to say and do vs. those that could potentially cause more harm. I can think of a gazillion obvious ones but it's the not-so-obvious ones that I'd like to learn about.

So, r/parenting... help? Books? Resources? They are/were in grief counselling, but if I'm not over the loss of their Mom... well, I can't imagine they are either. I just don't want to do more harm then good and would like to know what land mines I should be trying to avoid.

Thanks for any and all advice.
