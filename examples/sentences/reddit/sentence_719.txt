TITLE: Should I Wait?
POST: I'm a nineteen year old male and there's this girl that I work with, who's the same age as me, that I like, but the situation is kind of weird. After talking and flirting a bit and getting to know her more, I asked her if she would like to go out sometime (well not asked, I said that we should go out sometime). After I asked her out, she said she was going to think about it. Alright, I thought to myself, thinking she was going to say no, I figured that I should suck it up and move on.

So she sends me a text later saying that she doesn't have an answer for me yet and needs some time because she likes this other guy, but isn't sure if he likes her back. From what she told me, they've been hanging out for the summer, though I don't know if the guy likes her or not. I'm thinking that he doesn't because 1, obviously I don't want the other guy to get her, and 2, if nothing has happened after hanging out for the summer, maybe he only likes her as a friend.

I think she likes me as well, though, since she hasn't really said no and we're pretty flirty with each other when we're at work. I know that I'm the plan b right now and I'm not going to wait around forever (I've done that before >.>), but this girl is pretty cool and I like her a bunch, so is it worth waiting a little bit more? Should I just ask her who she's going to pick, me or him?
TL;DR:
