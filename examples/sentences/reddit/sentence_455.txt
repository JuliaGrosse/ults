TITLE: I [20M] becoming romantically interested in a friend [16F] and dont know what to do.
POST: I have known her for about 3 years. Became friends with her a year and a half ago. Being introverted and shy around girls it's hard for me to talk to her face to face but we've talked even if it isn't as much as I'd like, we've also gotten to know each other pretty well through messaging.(almost every day)

I have come to like her, but I have no way of telling if she likes me or not. She has made it clear that she thinks I'm amiable, and also noticed me not having as much face to face interaction, but I've made it clear that I'm shy and embarrassed.

I am well aware of the limitations for the age difference at the moment. I'm just so confused at the moment because some times it feels as if she is attracted to me, but that can be my imagination.
TL;DR:
