TITLE: What's the point of broadcast standards and practices?
POST: So the way I understand it (which admittedly may be mistaken) is that cable networks are not subject to FCC regulations so they can broadcast pretty much whatever they want.  However, every non-subscription based network has a standards and practices division to police the content to ensure advertisers and sponsors aren't guilty by affiliation to offensive material.

Here's what I don't understand though.  Advertisers want to get their ads out to as many viewers as possible and pay a premium to do so.  We as a society have demonstrated that we're less offended by rather normal things like sex and language.  The last episode of Game of Thrones had 7 million viewers, so I imagine if that show wasn't behind a pay wall that number would be much larger, and I think advertisers would be jumping at the chance to buy ad-space.  For a children's network it makes sense, but for any other it seems like S&P is a waste of money.
TL;DR:
