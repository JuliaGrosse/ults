TITLE: How to end it right?
POST: I dont even know if the title is possible.

Background:

Me and my current girlfriend have been dating for over 9 months now and its been pretty rocky. She is a good person for the most part but doesnt always treat me with sanity if you get my drift. We are both 23. 

I do love her and I dont want to hurt her - although I know thats not possible. We've talked about being soul mates and the "one" and all that Jazz and I honestly a couple of months ago believed it. Lately I have pulled away because I dont know if I want to be with her anymore.

Last night me and my brother went out (he is single) so I was wing manning for him and I accidently met an great girl and had a lot of fun with her. I am a good guy so I didnt do anything with her, but I really would like to see her again. 

Either way it made me realize I cant be with my current girlfriend as its getting far to serious (talks of moving in) and I dont want to be with her anymore.

Thats the simple part. I feel crappy and guilty about it as I know she loves me a lot. I've told this woman before I want to spend the rest of my life with her and now I dont? I know I cant possibly say it in a way to make it easy but is there anyway I can say it to make it easier.

I dont mind coming off as a bad guy if it will make her better or stronger willed. For example... if say I said I cheated on her, she would hate me but it wouldnt be as depressed if say I just dont love her anymore... Im not going to say that for obvious reasons - but I just dont know how I am going to see that sadness consume somebody again :(
TL;DR:
