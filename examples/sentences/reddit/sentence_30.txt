TITLE: Flatlined libido? Please say I'm not the only one & should I be worried? [Possibly NSFW]
POST: Hi loseit,

I'm sorry if this isn't necessarily relevant to weight loss, but it's the only correlating change in my life. If I'm doing wrong by posting here, please feel free to scorn me.

I've noticed over the past six months, whilst losing weight, that my libido has completely flatlined. I've searched everywhere for information on it or people with similar experiences only to find that weight loss has had the complete opposite effect on the majority of other people, with only breadcrumbs on information on a decreased libido.

Weight loss is the only thing I can think of that could be causing this. The relationship with my boyfriend is better than ever and I still find him thoroughly attractive, I just can't find sex engaging. And it's not just the physical side, the idea is doing nothing for me either; it's like I may as well be a eunuch. The first month of this happening I thought it might just be an off month for me; but six months down the line and it's beginning to worry me considerably. Should I consider seeing my GP about it?

Have any of you guys had a similar experience, or have any suggestions as to what may be causing it?
TL;DR:
