TITLE: My [22F] girlfriend is showing symptoms of hypochondria and it's driving me [25M] bonkers
POST: We've been in a relationship for almost 5 years now and marriage is definitely in our future, but every few months we have a slight problem. She gets really paranoid about the slightest health quirk. She'll have a headache when she wakes up and within a few hours it progresses into her being convinced she has cancer. And of course she stresses out and that only prolongs the headache and that becomes 'proof' that she has a tumor or something in hear head. Vicious cycle.

She has a history of displaying OCD-like tendencies when she was in her teens (doctor-confirmed, not the stupid 'I cleaned my room lulzocd') and has anxiety issues in general. She was on anxiety meds for a while and by her own admission it helped her not take the headaches or bug bites or whatever as seriously and to the next level like she was before. But financial issues and her owing the doctor's office money has kept her form being able to return and get a new prescription. 

It just happens every month or two and for a week she's an anxious, stressed out mess convinced that she's dying. And she never does, but she never seems to remember that and she never acknowledges it when I remind her. I love her death and will put up with this til the end of our days, but any way I can make this easier on us both would be much appreciated. I think part of the problem is that I don't know how to deal with it, so i'm not dealing with it very well at all. I want to be supportive, but not too supportive. I want to be stern and remind her it's in her head, but I don't want her to feel like no one has her back. What do I do?
TL;DR:
