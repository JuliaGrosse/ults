TITLE: Me [19M] with my friend [17F] of 1.5 months, I want to take things to the next level, but I don't know what's stopping her.
POST: Hey guys, I just need a second opinion on what's going on here. So there's a girl that is a friend of a friend and we met at new years which was at my own house. My friend invited her, and throughout the night her and I really hit it off. I got her number, and Snapchat, but my parents were around so that was all that happened. Since then her and I have hung out a few times, I took her to a movie once, and she also came over to my house once. I see her quite often as well because our friend group has been hanging out together a lot lately. When we hang out just her and I, she'll let me put my arm around her or whatever and get close to her, and we kiss. But whenever we're with our friend group she seems really hesitant, and none of the above happens, and it bothers me. I asked her if it was because she doesn't have feelings for me, and she says "I don't know exactly how I feel and it's difficult for me to tell." But after one incident of us being around the friend group and her being hesitant I stopped texting her so often. I used to always text first, but now that I stopped doing that she's texting me first. So why is it that she tells me "She doesn't know how she feels" but she still tries to talk to me, without giving me a serious answer? I'm trying to take this to the next level and it seems like she doesn't care. Lately she's been "busy" too, which means we haven't been able to find time to do anything. She knows that I'm really interested in her, and I don't know if she's just leading me on or if she's actually interested in me, but when I ask all I get is "I don't know". Is she interested, or not? How do I get a clear, concise answer?
TL;DR:
