TITLE: Am I being crazy? I feel like I am, but even knowing that I'm still upset.
POST: Okay, am I fucking crazy!? Is it wrong of me [22F] to be pissed at my bf[25M] for being friends with a girl I dislike very strongly.

The reason i dislike her is that girl and I had issues and then when we were drunk, she spilt some of her drink on me and then I said "could you not" and then she mumbled some shit and threw her beer bottle at me and then I chucked her bottle back at her (missed) and then I was going to beat her ass (I'm little compared to guys who know when I'm getting angry Lol I didn't get far)

And honestly I just feel shitty about it because I feel like I'm not supported. It's silly but all my other friends boyfriends have been in this situation and out of respect they just didn't associate with the person until their gfs made up. I feel like I'm being childish but I still can't help but feel like the only girl whose boyfriend just doesn't care.
TL;DR:
