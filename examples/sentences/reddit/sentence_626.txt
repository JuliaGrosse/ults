TITLE: My(25F) boyfriend(26M) broke up with me claiming he needed to be on his own and is seemingly already dating someone else...
POST: My(25F) boyfriend(26M) of about a year, whom I was madly in love with, recently broke my heart and shattered my world when he broke up with me out of the blue.  We've been living together for quite a while and have a puppy together.  Until about a week prior to the breakup, he was still talking about marriage and our future together.  When he ended things two weeks ago, he said he just needed space and to be by himself.  He said he couldn't commit to a relationship and that he needed to take a personal journey but that he believed and hoped that we'd find our way back to one another.  He said all of this with tears in his eyes.  Three days after he told me this, with much conviction I might add, I discovered that he is already seeing someone else.  Not to mention the fact that they are planning to go away together in one month, on the exact vacation he and I had been planning.  I feel so lost and I don't know what to do with myself.  I can't believe he's found it so easy to move on when I believed we were so deeply in love.  In retrospect, I really wouldn't have done anything differently throughout our relationship and really do believe that I treated him with utmost love and respect.  How do you recover from such betrayal and deceit?
