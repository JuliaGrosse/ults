TITLE: Should i even go there?
POST: The First post 

The boy/man i like age 21 male, is someone who is a volunteer at my local establishment im age 23 female He is really funny, we get along like a house on fire pretty much from the get go. Ive always thought of him to be attractive but never anythig more - I thought he was gay. We've always had a bit of a flirty banter and we've spent a lot of time together (only at the establishment he volunteers and i visit as a "young person") 
Anyway. I recently found out he is only "questioning" his sexuality and has a sexual intrest in me. (He called me beautiful- d'aww.) 
The only way we'd be able to have a relationship is if i was to become a volunteer (something i WAS going to do anyway - but this is pushing me), but i have that nigle in my head of his questioning sexuality. What would i do/how would i feel if he wanted to be with a bloke?(man) but we were together?
Should i even go there?
What if we get along really well as friends, but a relationship wouldnt work?
Ive also told him A LOT about my past.. (Which i thought i was comfortable doing because i thought he wasnt actually interested in me) which i may have not told him/held back a while if i had known
(Though he called me beautiful after all this..) 
HELP!!! What do i do - do i try it? "Life is too short for regrets" or just.. Remain good ones? (Friends)
TL;DR:
