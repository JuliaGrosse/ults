TITLE: I [18/F] just found out I'm pregnant (by SO [18/M]). How do I tell my roommates [19's/F's] about it and that I need to move out?
POST: I recently moved into a duplex with two good friends of mine, Lisa and Katie. We get along great and I enjoy living here, and they don't mind my boyfriend, Jeremy, living here as well (all three of us have boyfriends who either live here or stay most of the nights here). Our lease isn't up until May of next year.

I found out I'm pregnant, and far enough along to be pretty sure it's gonna stick. I work a minimum wage job, and Jeremy makes $9/hour. It's not exactly the most comfortable situation to have a child in. Jeremy is in the military and will be going to basic training soon, so he won't be able to help financially until after he gets back.

This has created a bit of a problem, as I can't afford to pay rent and utilities here while also saving up for costs of a baby. Jeremy's parents have offered us their basement until the baby is a bit older, I have a better job, and Jeremy is done with training. It will be free of charge, and I have a better job lined up if I move in with them. That would allow me to buy the things I need for the baby, and put some money away for when we leave Jeremy's parent's house.

How do I tell Lisa and Katie that I need to move out? I can legally do it if I give at least 30 day's notice, but my share of rent and utilities would be really tough for them to have to pay on their own after I moved out. Like I said before, we're all great friends and I want to find a way to do this without upsetting anybody.
TL;DR:
