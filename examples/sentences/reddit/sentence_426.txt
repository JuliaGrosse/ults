TITLE: My friend (18f) and I (18m) have know each other for about 6 months. Over the last month or so she has begun remarking out loud how amazing my eyes and smile are. What's this mean? If anything
POST: So this girl and I (both 18) have known each other since the start of the summer, we were introduced by being in the same "friend group" at school. Over the last month or so, she repeatedly (at least once a week, like, 5 times last week) makes comments about how "beautiful" my eyes and smile are and says she loves looking at my eyes and it is at this point she'd proceed to stare for a little more than a few seconds (words like gorgeous, amazing, and beautiful have all been used by her to describe my eyes). I've never thought of her as someone that likes me, but a friend of mine pointed these things out to me. What's your guys/girls take on the situation? I'd like to note that these comments are always made with our other friends around, there is never any one on one conversation going on here.
TL;DR:
