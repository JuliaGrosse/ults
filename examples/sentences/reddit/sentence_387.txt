TITLE: Rather odd tax question concerning dependents
POST: This year, I remarried and the woman I am married to has a son.  He lives with us and I treat and support him as if he was my own son.  I have also been supporting him financially for more than 6 months out of the year and know that I am allowed to claim him as a dependent. My wife and her son are both from the philippines and not yet U.S. Citizens.  Haven't even filed the adjustment yet (doing it this month) to have them changed to permanent residents.

Anyway, the thing I'm wondering is if that $1000 business applies in this situation.  I'm also not sure how that benefit works.  I have a daughter from a previous marriage and I know the first year I had her, it seemed like when I added her in TurboTax, $1000 was immediately added on to the amount of my return.

Is that how this is supposed to work or is it supposed to be a $1000 credit against the amount I am being taxed on?  Do you get this benefit every year?  Do you get it for each child?  Does it apply to me with my new step-son even though there has been no legal adoption or anything?
TL;DR:
