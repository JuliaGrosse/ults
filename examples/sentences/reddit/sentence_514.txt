TITLE: [17/m] girl i like just got out of a relationship (17/f)
POST: Ok so I met this girl about a year ago when I started flirting with her at the mall. I got her number and we started texting each other. We hung out a couple of times but after she told me she liked someone else we started to drift apart. A couple weeks ago we started talking again. I asked her out over text and she told me that she was flattered but she had broken up with her bf about 2 weeks ago. She told me she would keep my offer in mind when she was ready to date again. She finished off by saying " I'm just not into the whole dating thing yet" I told her I was sorry to hear that and that she should take all the time she needs. So my question is, does she like me, what can I do to show her I really care, and what should I say to her from now on. I'm sure older redditors have good advice they can give me. Thank you! :)
TL;DR:
