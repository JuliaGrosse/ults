TITLE: Need help!
POST: I just moved into a house with my girlfriend and sister and they both have dogs. Both are female, one is a black lab the other is a rat terrier. The lab is fixed but my girlfriends terrier is not and she refuses to get her fixed until she breeds her. The terrier isn't very well house trained (my girlfriend had the dog before we met) I practically trained the dog as best I could. I've done everything and anything I possibly could to train the pup to go outside and for brief instances she's actually good about it. However since my sister started living with us I've noticed how the terrier is urinating and well, shitting EVERYWHERE. I literally laid down on my couch and the minute I do the terrier jumps up and urinates right beside me! 
My girlfriend is oblivious to it and doesn't/hasn't treated this like a serious issue since the dog is well over a year and a half old. I've never personally raised a dog on my own before so I'm kind of lost here. Any advice or helpful hints would be greatly appreciated since our landlord does business with my family and I don't want to ruin any of that because of my girlfriends dog.
TL;DR:
