TITLE: Keeping a house dog hair free
POST: I'm in a relationship with a girl who has 2 dogs. I like dogs, but haven't had or lived with one since I was living with my parents because I HATE dog hair. For career reasons, our relationship is approaching the point where I need to shit or get off the pot over letting her move in with me.

The problem is she has a golden retriever mix and Brittany spaniel mix and her apartment is COVERED in dog hair. She can spend half a day cleaning it and it seems like it's covered again in a day. I can deal with spending time at her apartment fine, but I don't know if I can get used to the idea of my entire house constantly being like that and having no escape from the dog hair. Is it possible to have a relatively hair-free household with 2 dogs that shed a lot? If so, how? Would frequent professional groomings do the trick? I want to make this relationship work but I'm having a hard time getting past this.
TL;DR:
