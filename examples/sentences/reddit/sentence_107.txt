TITLE: My[19f] boyfriend[20m] of 1 and a half years just broke up with me. Need help handling it.
POST: Hello lovely people of reddit!

My first boyfriend and love broke up with me today. We were together over 1 and a half years. I know I'm only young, and I have a lot going for me, but I can't stop crying and I don't want to feel like this anymore.

About 1-2 months ago, I started becoming depressed again. Nothing like my past episodes (which were before we were dating), but there was a notable change in my personality. I was quick to get angry at my boyfriend. Then my boyfriend starting checking out of the relationship, which only made matters worse.

I can't help but feel so angry and upset with myself. If I had got a handle on my sadness, we'd still be together. If I was the old me he'd still want me, because we were very much in love at that time.

He only broke up with me today, but since I have already been so down lately, and have never experienced a break up before, I'm finding it hard to cope.

If you kind people could give me some advice I would really appreciate it. I know I'm young and I'll move on, but unfortunately that's not tackling my sadness right this second. What can I do to feel happy again?
TL;DR:
