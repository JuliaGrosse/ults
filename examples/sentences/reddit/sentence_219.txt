SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Am I (20F) getting major red flags from a guy I just met (20-something M) or am I just paranoid?
POST: I work at a cafe and recognized a regular on the street. I'd had a few very brief interactions with him before, but I immediately recognized him because I'm fairly good with faces. I decided to say hi and make small talk, and I end up with his number. I had no intention of flirting, but I think he interpreted my approach the wrong way so he asked if I wanted to hang out sometime. I said sure why not, what's the harm in hanging out. I like getting to know people and he seems nice. 

I text him saying, "Hey it's blahblah, let me know if you want to hang out". He responds saying that he thinks I'm sexy and smart, and that he would love to hang out and potentially even cuddle. He says that he's so happy to have met me and that he could never forget our first encounter. 

I've never been on a date, never had a boyfriend, never flirted with someone so I had no clue how to respond. I was flattered but slightly put off to be honest. 

Then texts me that he has to tell me that I'm a huge turn-on for him.

Wooahh....does not compute...brain.not.functioning....I don't know where any of this came from. I've only known him by name for a week and we've only actually talked for a total of ~ 10 minutes. 

Is this just called being "confident" or is this guy just being creepy? Is it pathetic that I kind of enjoy this strange attention? People are telling me I should run for the hills, but I'm not quite sure what to do.
TL;DR:
