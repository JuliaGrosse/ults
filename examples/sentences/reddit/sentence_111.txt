SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I (21 m) was dumped by my girlfriend who I had a kid with after 2 years.
POST: It's been a month now and she's moved on but I still love her and it's hard for me to accept. I wish I could just move on myself but being the way I am, it's hard to meet new people and open up. Our son is 8 months old so things in the relationship moved rather quickly. I can help but feel worthless over this. I guess I'm not sure what to do, I've been trying and trying but every time I go to pick up my son it just gets harder and harder to see her. I'm afraid my son will think of her new boyfriend as his dad instead of me, even though I'm doing my best to see him overt day and take him over night. It just hurts so fucking much. I guess I don't know who to turn to to get these feelings out so I guess I'll just post it here and hope for the best. I'm here asking if you guys have any advice for moving on in my situation, considering my son and everything.
TL;DR:
