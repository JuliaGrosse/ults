TITLE: I've [31/m] got some interesting questions about my platonic friend [26/f]
POST: I've moved to a city, I'll be here temporarily. Through OKCupid, I've made a friend here who's about five years younger than I am. She and I are good friends, and other than a drunken kiss (For context, we were drunk, but I'm not comfortable with pursuing things with drunken women, so I paid for a cab to get her home safe). 
Shortly after, she made it quite clear that we're better as friends, and in balance, that was a better thing to do. I am, however, having an issue with some of the ways she crosses lines â€“ If she's not attracted to me, I'm pretty uncomfortable with the fact that she puts her head in my lap when she comes by to watch movies. I have spoken to her about it, and she sees that it's a space-and-signals thing. She also has no problem telling me about guys that she's slept with, albeit in oblique ways I'm less and less attracted to her because of some maturity issues she has, but she's a nice person to be around.
At this point, I would really like to know a few things, and would appreciate opinions: 
1) Why tell me who you're sleeping with?

2) There's a clear maturity gap. I don't make friends very easily, and it's a pattern of behaviour which I've been trying to break, as it's important to have a diverse group of friends around. That being said, would it be a good idea to continue the friendship?
TL;DR:
