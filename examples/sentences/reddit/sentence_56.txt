SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice
TITLE: Am I wasting my time with her? Need advice
POST: Let me explaine my situation (Sorry if I make mistakes, english isn't my first language). So I'm a 20yo male, been dating this girl for 3-4 months and it's my first relationship. I've known her for 3 years and she has been treated like shit by her 2 other boyfriends in the past, I should also mention that she is on heavy anti anxiety meds and has depression (this will seems like an important detail)

Anyway hear is why i'm asking this - everything was just perfect until about 3 weeks ago, at first the contact was constant, we would text everyday and with time it became more rational and we'ed text a bit through the week before we saw each other. This all stopped after one date where she told me the L word for the first time - one week no contact, and when i texted she replied 1 week later. The thing is, we still saw each other on a date, and she was affectionate and all, but then BAM she goes cold on me by text again but a week and a half latter we see each other again and it's all normal in person again.

I have confronted her about this, asked if everything was ok but she gave me very vague answers like "I'm the kind of person who needs to think about there problems before asking for others people's oppinions" and "You can talk about anything with me" (In my head I was like : wtf, you never answer your phone and text when the planets are aligned) 

I should also add that I left the country for a month and a half 4 days ago (maybe that has somthing to do with her distance? but shouldn't it be the opposit?)
TL;DR:
