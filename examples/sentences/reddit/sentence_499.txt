TITLE: I'm scum I know it (MF both 38)
POST: Ok, I made a bad decision a few years back while going through some crazy shit and cheated on my wife in an anonymous one-night deal. I confessed to her and have spent the last 2-3 years paying for that poor decision. (Haha understatement of the year. I get it I'm scum.)

Now down the road I find her growing distant to me, again. I've not done anything bad of late and our communication and financial issues have been subsiding but she's drawing back. We've had a year or two of marital counseling and have talked on and off again about divorce. We've both in the recent past gone so far as to retain attorneys.

The last few months things had gotten better, I thought the improved communication was bringing growing intimacy but now with this? Tonight is Valentine's and she wanted to go off and read alone all evening. Now I just started a new job and find myself flirting with some of the women there and am feeling like pursing another one night stand just for the attention.
TL;DR:
