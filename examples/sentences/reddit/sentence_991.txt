TITLE: Me [32 M] with my Wife [28 F] of 2 years - with a baby on the way - Birthday Gift Expectations.
POST: So my wife and I are high income earners - but we come from humble backgrounds, so only on rare occasion do we buy each other expensive gifts. For example, her engagement ring was $36,000.00 - but her Christmas gift last year was $300.00. 

Most of our gifting for each other's birthday's and christmas's are in the $300 - $500 range.  On rare occasion, we will buy more expensive gifts. 

So this year, my wife, for her birthday, wanted a full day spa retreat.  Thus, for her birthday gift, I bought her a full day spa retreat package - last about 8 hours - cost of $400.00 before tip (which of course, I will pay).

As her birthday approaches, my wife has been also been dropping hints that she has been eyeing a particular designer bag.  

So my question is simple - what are my wife's birthday expectations?  Is she expecting the purse in addition to the spa retreat?  Or is she just letting me know for perhaps valentine's day?  I just want to make sure I don't let her down.
TL;DR:
