SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Figured out my [M22] college 'family' will be seperating much sooner than I'd like. Pretty depressed about the whole situation.
POST: I'm really blindsided by this whole thing. I was under the assumption that I was going to be living with the people that were basically my family for the past 2 years until next spring. I recently got word that the people owning the house we re living in want to sell the house in august. I figured we d all have the summer together still but now it seems like the people that I was closest with are going to be leaving in 2 weeks. I seriously haven't cried in years until today. Like I said these people have been like family to me and have helped me do much in getting over my anxiety and depression and becoming the person I want to be. I'm just shocked by this situation now and kind of terrified that all of the positive things I've learned are going to fade away once I go seperate ways from my roommates. Some of them will stay in the city Im in. Others I might never see again. Thinking about finding another place to live makes me want to throw up right now. I knew this would happen eventually...just not like this. I'm not sure what advice I even need right now. Im afraid that Im not going to find another place to live like this or group of friends like this again. I'm afraid my life is going to fall apart after this summer. I'm afraid of feeling alone and weak like before. I just want the fear to go away.
TL;DR:
