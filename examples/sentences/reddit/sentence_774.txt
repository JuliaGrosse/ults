TITLE: Found out some info via snooping (I know!).  Can't say anything, but feel like shit.
POST: So I found out that this guy that I thought didn't want to date me because of timing issues actually had this plan to dump me to get back together with his ex-gf.  I was friends with him after we stopped dating and everything actually seemed pretty good, we got along really well and stuff, but after finding this out, I could not be normal, and am pretty sure I'll never talk to him again.  Which is fine, I think it needed to happen, but it still makes me feel so worthless.  We met online, didn't date for long, but it just makes me feel like crap that he didn't just say, "I think I still have feelings for my ex, so we probably shouldn't date."  And then continued to be friends with me, and tried to have sex with me.  I guess I was just hoping someone might have a similar experience and insight into this situation.
TL;DR:
