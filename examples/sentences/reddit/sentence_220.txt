TITLE: How do I [24M] get my ex-girlfriend [23F] back?
POST: Two months ago she left me without any real notice. We've been together for 6 years. She was my best friend, we planned our future (marriage/children) together. Honestly, it was for the better to take a break. We both fought a lot over small things and each of us were having issues with ourselves. She was depressed and being distant which caused me to feel unwanted and to stop contributing to the relationship. It was a cycle that lasted for about a month. There was a loss of communication and thats when it went downhill and she left and moved out.

Fast forward to now, 2 months later. I've realized the mistakes I made and what I needed to change. I put myself ahead of everyone else and only cared about my interests. I was an asshole and didn't give her the interest she deserved. I don't blame her for leaving and like I said it was probably for the best that we take a break.

Needless to say I want her back. I don't want to jump right back into a relationship but I want to still talk to her with the hope of rekindling what we once had. The issue is, I have no way of contacting her. She blocked me on all social media, I don't know her new cell phone number, I have an email but she won't respond. She says that she doesn't want to talk because she doesn't think I changed and we tried before without it getting better. She only thinks about how much we fought and although she cares about me, has no desire to talk. I know this because she still talks to my mom. 

r/Relationships, what do I do? This wasn't just a girlfriend from high school, she was who I wanted to spend my life with - I still do. Im afraid I lost the person who made everything worthwhile. "Theres other fish in the sea". She was my sea.
TL;DR:
