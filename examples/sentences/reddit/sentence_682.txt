SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [23/F] with my ex-boyfriend[22/M] have been dating a year, recently broke up but I'm confused and not sure what to do
POST: I've known my now ex boyfriend for over 10 years (since high school). We used to be best friends, and then I got married, moved out of the country and we stopped talking because my husband at the time didn't like him, so my friend decided it was best to leave it alone since I was happy.

I recently came back home when my dad got sick, and found out I was getting divorced. He was there for me, like the best friend he was, like nothing had ever changed. We started dating unexpectedly and were for about a year. I recently got accepted to another college, about 45 minutes away. 

I thought we should break up because I wasn't sure if I could handle a relationship with school and work and I was worried about not seeing each other and one of us cheating and everything else awful. We broke up, but it's still like we never broke up. Only a few people know, but we still spend the night with each other. We talk all day, everyday. Hang out, eat, play video games etc. 

I've tried just not talking and cutting all ties, but I love him and I can't. It literally hurts if we don't talk. I could honestly see myself marrying him with kids one day. I'm not one to be open about feelings, but he's the person I know I can count on, day or night no matter what. We technically broke up, but everything is the same, except we're friends, and I ask him to not call me "honey" or "babe" or be affectionate. 

I asked about friends with benefits, but it doesn't seem like it at all. I don't know if I should say yes we're back together, since it already seems it, or if I just need to keep it and slowly separate.
TL;DR:
