TITLE: My [22M] attitude towards women makes it almost impossible to date. How do I change?
POST: Before I get called a misyoginist let me give a bit of background. I was the nice kid in hs who was very trusting of others, waited a whole year to ask his crush out to get shut down. Many more things happened after that affected my hesitant attitudes in all things involving long term relationships. I was raised around mostly women and I am a very emotional guy.There was once a pattern of women constantly telling me "you're too emotional" which I have been working through. Now my issue is that I tend to dismiss anything positive about a girl I meet even if it seems as if we had a great time. I have become emotionally distant to the point of not caring a bit about women I have slept with for months. This is obviously not healthy and I want to take steps to change that. About 9 months ago I met a girl who was so amazing in my eyes. The best way I could describe it was that we discussed topics from history to culture for hours on the phone and it was some of the best times I have had. I usually get bored after a minute on the phone wih other girls and rather text. Anyway she ghosted me after a couple weeks  without any reason.I know it could have been the way I acted in our last date since I was being very sexually suggestive even though she clearly expressed it was too early. The thing is I wanted something real with her but I was telling myself how she was not the best I could do physically and all those other things. How do I become a more respectful guy when it comes to dating? I sometimes act like a jerk and act careless while I know a part of me doesn't feel good about that behavior.
TL;DR:
