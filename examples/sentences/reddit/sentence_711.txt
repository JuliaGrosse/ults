SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [20/F] saw the girl I'm seeing[20/F] go upstairs for platonic cuddling with a guy [20/M] while I stayed downstairs as a third wheel.
POST: Hello Hello.

This is my first female-female relationship-esque. We realized we were both into each other at Steve Aoki which led to sleepovers/cuddles, relationship conversations X Y Z. This has been going on for less than a month.

Everything was good (some minor red flags but nothing I can't overlook since a 0.7 can round to the 1) we drove 6 hours together back to our city from our hometown. We held hands, we make out, she tells me I'm beautiful that-- you get the point.

Things got tricky when we were drinking at a mutual friends house last night. 5 people are there except one guy isn't drinking because he has biking in the morning, which led to him going to bed around 1130. Overall the night was going pretty well in my opinion until 1130 when he went to bed and she immediately got dressed into her sleep attire/followed him upstairs for some platonic cuddles. All in the name of me taking her spot to sleep on the couch (?)

So now I've become this third wheel with our mutual friend/her boyfriend. They know her and I have started a thing, to which they both looked at me when she went upstairs. I didn't have anything to say, she's not my girlfriend.

Yet, I felt so hurt.

She texted me this morning asking if I was sick last night (which I was) and told me that I should have told her because she would have taken care of me... I don't want to complicate this by getting upset about what she did and yet part of me reeeeeallly wants to tell her to go fuck herself.

How do I proceed homies?
