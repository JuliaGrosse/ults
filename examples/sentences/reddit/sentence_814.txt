SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: Hey reddit, do you think looking at cam-whore girls is wrong if you have a girlfriend?
POST: My girlfriend asked me what I look at when I masturbate. I told her I either click on a few videos on redtube or youporn, or I go to livejasmin or cam4 and watch the cam chat girls. She was ok with watching traditional porn, but when i mentioned that I go to camming websites, she was saddened. I read an askreddit post about communicating with girls on /r/gonewild, and that most people thought this was worse than simply viewing porn, since you can private message the girls on gonewild, and possibly chat with them. The reason I watch cam girls is because the traditional 'porn' look is pretty gross IMO. I find normal/amateur girls more attractive than girls with fake tits and way too much makeup. In any event, I told her (and I plan to stick to this) that I will refrain from visiting camming websites.
What do you guys think?
TL;DR:
