TITLE: How much attention is too much attention?
POST: Ok, here's the deal... I (37F) was in a long term relationship (5 yrs) and we broke up about 3 years ago. I wanted to give myself time to get over the person before dating someone new and pretty much threw myself into work and anything else non-dating related.
Fast forward to the present -I met a guy last week (46M) at a party and we totally hit it off. We've been talking and texting everyday since then. The problem is that it's been so long since I've dated someone I'm afraid I'm going to fuck it up. I really like this guy and don't want to scare him off with too much attention.
TL;DR:
