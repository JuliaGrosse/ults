TITLE: My [27M] fiance might leave me [26F] because I can't have children. I don't know what to do.
POST: I hope this is an ok place to post. I don't have a support network with whom I can talk about things like this and I felt the need to let it out.

Today my fiance informed me that he may break off our engagement due to the fact that I can't have children. We've been together for 7 1/2 years and have known about my inability to have children for almost a year now (he proposed six months ago).

I was quite taken by surprise. I have made peace with the fact that I'm unable to have kids and I thought he had as well. He's never said anything to make me think otherwise until today.

I asked him why having biological children is so important to him and he said it was "what he thinks is right". He believes his purpose in life is to create and cultivate more life in order to improve society as a whole. My retort was that he can still improve the next generation through what he gives to an adopted child. He had no response.

Now he's "still thinking about it". I feel like I'm trapped in some strange limbo where I don't know if life is going to continue as normal or fall apart completely. Also, there's no way I could afford to live in the city we live in on my own income, so now there's a possibility that I will have to quit my job and move back to my hometown (probably into my mother's house) until I get settled.

I feel like there's nothing I can do. I cannot change the thing that would cause him to leave. All I can do is wait for him to make up his mind. Part of me wants to beg him to stay, but I that doesn't seem like the right thing to do.

I'm writing this because I cannot sleep, I can't stop crying. There's a possibility that he cares for an ideological scenario in his head more than he cares for me, and I don't know how to cope with that. I don't know how to compete with something intangible.
TL;DR:
