TITLE: My[35M] coworkers[30-60F] are being irritating and mocking me because of a patient[23F], administration is being half-assed as usual, what's the best way to not get irritated?
POST: Im a psychiatric nurse, I've worked at the same facility for 6 years. Administration in general is decent but a bit overwhelmed, if it's not something major they let it go. I love working here and I'm not going to leave.

One of my patients is here permanently, she's 23 and over all a very sweet girl but she's also mentally ill. Even the doctors aren't quite sure what exactly is wrong it seems to be a mixture of things(heavily delusional,mild situational depressed, some histrionic traits). Medications just seem to make her physically sick. Her parents are older and can't handle her, she can't live on her own or in a group home. She's been here 5 years.

She's also in love with me. She runs up and hugs me, tells me all about her day(most of which didn't happen but whatever), asks me about mine. She's quite bright and tries to be helpful. I'm fond of her, she looks very similar to my daughter(12) so I just treat her like I would want someone to treat my little girl if she was in this situation.

A few of coworkers won't stop mocking me because of her. They call her my girlfriend and ask when we're getting married. Make kissing noises when I walk past her room(I work 2p-2am). It's just damn annoying, I'm moving to a 8am-8pm shift in a few months so I won't being as much of them.

What are some good ways to ignore them or politely tell them to shove it?
