TITLE: Me(18M) refused a gift from my brother(21m) and friends because I did not want them to waste money on me. I'm not sure if I did the right thing.
POST: So I'm gonna do a skydive on Sunday and for 180 New Zealand dollars the will make a video of this experience. I said to my family that I don't want a video of this experience and that it's to expensive for me anyway. So my brother said no worries I will fix something for you. So again I said that I don't want this video and that he should not be wasting money on something that I don't want. 5 minutes later he donated 180 New Zealand dollars as a gift from him and 5 friends. At this moment I was quite upset because he did not care about what I said and 5 minutes later I gave him te money back with a explanation why I refuse to take it. And now my brother is pissed at me for not excepting his gift. Did I do the right thing by refusing their money so that it won't be wasted or am I overreacting and let them decide what to spend their money on?
TL;DR:
