TITLE: How do I ask for very specific Christmas present without seeming selfish/greedy?
POST: I'm 24, and my BF is 28. We live together (for the past three months) and we've been together a year.

We have recently come through some really, really tough times together, and are slowly getting back to good. It's work everyday, but it's worth it, because I love him and love our life together. 

I'm the kind of person who has always lauded gifts picked out from the heart over ones I've asked for, but I know that my BF is not the romantic type to catch my signals when I hint at something. I feel selfish for thinking about it, but I really want this one specific thing for Christmas this year, as it seems to me that it would be such a sweet symbol of our strenth through these recent struggles. 

I have realized that it would be nice if HE picked it out for that reason, but it's just not him. He would never think of that! And even though I've hinted (ie liked the item on facebook), he's not going to pick up the hints. I know him too well! 

Here is what I want: 

I only want it in silver, so I know it's in his price range. 

Here's my question: does it devaule the sentiment and gift if I ask my boyfriend for it? Does it make me seem greedy? I'm not ring hungry...ie he know's we're not near marriage. I've never asked for anything before and he has always given me perfect gifts, but not of this caliber (no jewlery). Men and ladies, what do you think? Is it appropriate to ask?
TL;DR:
