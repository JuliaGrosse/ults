TITLE: What should I do with my schizophrenic Grandfather
POST: As the title says, i'm not to sure what I should do with him. Im 17, and I take care of him while my mom is at work. Usually that's just making sure he takes his medication, and eats food. Recently, hes started to drink. His psychiatrist ( amazing lady ) told him he has to stop, and he agreed to, but he hasn't. My mom thinks that all the booze is gone, but I know he still has some ( called the local taxi company to pick him up some vodka ). Last  night, he wouldn't take his meds, and drank instead. 

I'm not sure if I should tell my mom about this, it is quite a common thing when she isn't here. The only thing that is making me not tell her is that he is 72, it is his life. He is well aware he is ill, and knows drinking isn't a good combo with his meds.
TL;DR:
