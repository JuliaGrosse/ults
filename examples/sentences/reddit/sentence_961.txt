TITLE: Me [40F], how on earth do you start dating after separation/divorce?
POST: I am separated and will likely be divorced.  My husband and I have been together since I was in college and I literally feel like I have no idea how to date.  Everything is online?  God I feel so old saying that.  I know Tinder is mostly for hookups?  I'd like to go on some actual dates, but am not looking for anything serious, just want to start meeting some people.  But having sex with someone, I don't know at this point.  I was never much into casual sex (serial monogamist here) so that thought terrifies me too.  I really have no idea what the best way is to go about putting myself out there a bit.  I'm generally pretty attractive, decent body type, so I get attention from men but dating...??  Ugh.
TL;DR:
