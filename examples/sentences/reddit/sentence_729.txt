TITLE: [15 M] want to get closer to [15 F] crush
POST: There is a girl at my school that at my school that I have had a crush on for the whole year basically.  We've gone to the same school for our whole lives, but she will soon be moving across town to another high school.

A little background, we've talked a little inthe past.  We are not quite friends, but aquaintances.  We only have one class this year, and I asked her to homecoming.  She declined because she said she wasn't going at all, which she didn't.

I had a thing with a different girl for awhile.  We had our thing since March 1st and we started dating May 2nd.  She dumped me last Thursday however and we have not spoken since, and I have lost any feelings for her.  And rediscovered my feelings for the other girl.

I want to get close to her this summer.  Like actually get to know her and be her friend.  I am hoping that eventually that friendship would lead to dating but it isn't my number one priority.  How could I do this, school ends for me in a week so I need to act fast.
TL;DR:
