SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [23 M] am best friends with a couple [23 M--24 F]. They split up, and now me and his ex have strong feelings for one another.
POST: Practically 5 years ago my best friend (of 13 years) got together with this girl. 

In 5 years of relationship me and her have gotten quite close and definitely can open up to each other more than to any other person. Now they split up as he had been cheating on her. Me and her were attracted to each other and for about 4 days fooled about a bit a week after the break-up. 
I have never been with someone I can act this natural around in an intimate setting and she agrees. We could speak about anything and were completely open about our feelings.

  I tried to speak to my friend about the situation and he says he still has feeling for her and I must choose between him and her. I chose him and now she says she won't be able to be part of the same circle of friends anymore as she can't bring herself to be chummy with her ex of 5 years whom she left as he had been cheating on her and cant be in constant contact with the guy she loves. Apparently she had been dreaming about me for 5 months before the breakup.

Now, my dilemma is, do I side with my male friend (who tends to be quite a selfish person) or try to start a relationship with the girl as I wouldn't be able to stand having her out of my life?
TL;DR:
