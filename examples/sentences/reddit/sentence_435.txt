SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [18M] am into a girl [18F] who I just found out (from her) that has a history of cheating.
POST: So, for the past few months I have been talking to, and now, flirting with this one girl. We became really close friends and things were looking as if at any moment we could enter a relationship. However, a few days ago we had a very deep conversation about personal flaws and mistakes we have made in the past. That was the moment that I learned about how she has cheated on other guys before.

According to her, the first person she dated was abusive and overall horrible to her, so she cheated on him when she was an environment where he wasn't present, and subsequently their relationship ended. But, this was not an isolated incident. She also told me that when with her next SO, she cheated on him with two entirely separate guys, both whom were dating someone else at the time. 

My only response when I heard all this information was "why?" to which she replied "because I'm a horny mess and can't control myself".

There are so many red flags here it's actually unbelievable. It's like some kind of crazy red flag fiesta.

Despite all of that, she told me that she regrets her having cheated and realizes how awful and fucked up her actions were. Most importantly she said that she is determined to change and is actively working on improving herself and not making the same past mistakes and decisions.

On top of all that, this is a person with whom I'm more comfortable than with anyone else and I value as a friend above all else. 

I honestly don't know what to do.
TL;DR:
