TITLE: Girl [25] I'm [24M] seeing is into really hard drugs and partying and sees me as boring because I'm not.
POST: So this girl I've been meeting with for the past month or so is great, really into her. However she is a seriously hard partier, hard drug fuelled raves and what not 3 or 4 nights of the week and whilst this doesn't bother me so much, she says I'm really boring for turning down her offers to these events. Her saying this recently has really started to bother me. I want to be exciting and be involved with this part of her life but truth be told I don't really have the balls to try taking the heavy stuff she does and I think me going to these events tagging along with her group sipping a beer isn't really going to help the 'boring' image of me in her head.

Advice on how to approach handling this situation reddit? Her words of describing me as very normal and a bit boring have hurt me a little worst as it's had time to distil in my mind. Am I boring because I don't like snort cocaine nightly?
TL;DR:
