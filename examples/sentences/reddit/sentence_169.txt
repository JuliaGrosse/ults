TITLE: Broke my best friend's heart.  What do I do to make this split a little easier on us?
POST: My best friend (18M) and I (18F) have grown a lot closer over the past couple of months, and it apparently escalated to a bit more on his side. I have a boyfriend who I love very much, and I have no intentions of leaving him.  The other day, I told my best friend that I wouldn't leave my current boyfriend.  I feel like I completely broke his heart, and I feel awful for it.  I have no way of avoiding him as we have classes together all the time, and I don't know that I even want to avoid him in the first place.  I'm afraid that this will send him back into a depression (for which he's already on medication).  Are there any thing I can do to make this easier on the both of us?  Has anyone else gone through this before and wants to share the story? I need words of encouragement to stay strong and not guilt myself into giving him everything he wants just  because I feel bad for what I've done to him.
TL;DR:
