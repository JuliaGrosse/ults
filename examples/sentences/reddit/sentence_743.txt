TITLE: She's pregnant and so was I.
POST: I've been friends with him for 13 years, since I was 14.  He proclaimed his undying love to me when I was 17, yet I friend-zoned him.  At 22 I gave in and we dated for a year.  The relationship ended when I got pregnant.  I told him I was pregnant and he said he wasn't ready to be a dad and asked me if "you want to keep it?"  I asked him if he was ready to man up and be a dad and he said no. I was in no shape to be raising a kid on my own.  I made minimum wage and lived in a shitty part of town and had no hope of a raise at my job.  So I made the appointment at the abortion clinic in Pittsburgh, and he drove me there, waited til it was over, and drove me home.  We never talked again.... Until... I got a new job, and what do you know, his Mom is the hostess.  His aunt is my boss.  AND his girlfriend at the time is a fill in waitress.  WELL, over summer he married his girlfriend and today I just found out she's pregnant.  Also his other aunt and two cousins work there and everyone is bouncing off the walls about their pregnancy and I'm supposed to be so fucking happy for them as well.  Yeah I fake it well, but on the inside I just want to scream.  What the fuck was wrong with me!?!?  Her family has money and mine doesn't, and he's hinted as to that was the reasoning, but really, to be fine with an abortion and then TRY because her family has money. FUCK YOU.  He actually told me he would have married me if it wasn't for her rich parents and their guaranteed vacations every year.
