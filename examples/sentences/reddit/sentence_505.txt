TITLE: Male with significant past trauma struggling to show interested in women physically
POST: Hey /r/AskWomen so I am a 27 year old male and I am struggling with the Physical aspects of letting a women know I am interested in her, including body language.

When I was between 4-12 I was significantly abused by an immediate family member to the point that I was removed from the house by social services. Since then I have been through a lot of therapy and three successful long term relationships. However, because of the abuse physical contact in a relationship comes very slow to me. I have to build trust with the girl to feel comfortable touching her or having her touch me. This includes kissing and sometimes even hugging can be a little awkward with me. Once I have been dating the girl for a couple month (2-5) I am able to be physical in all aspects and I am very comfortable with only a few hiccups. 

The problem really comes through when I meet a girl I am interested and we just start dating. I have a hard time showing the girl I am interested in them. Several time over the years I have had women come back to me and say "What happened between us? I really liked you and I thought you liked me to but you never did anything?" They usually elaborate saying they knew I was interested in them because I would always want to spend time with them and I was checking them out, but then I would never make a move and eventually they thought I just wanted to be friends and they would move on.

My question is what tips or strategies do you have to help me in the "getting to know you stage" show a girl I'm interested in them for sure, without disclosing too fast all the trauma I experienced as a child. The three relationships I managed to have the girl sought me and I did not have to do much work. Most women I encounter (sorry for generalization) seem to expect me to make the first moves.
TL;DR:
