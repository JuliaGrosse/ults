TITLE: My girlfriend [20F] and I [21M] want to move in together. Her parents are problematic
POST: First, we've been dating about 7 months now. However, we've known each other personally for 7 years.

Anyway, we decided to move in together because,

1) It would be cheaper 

2) We work opposite shifts, so living together would give us more time together

3) We've agreed we wouldn't want to get married before we live together for at least a year, and we feel close enough with our relationship dynamic being perfect right now that it's a very real possibility to happen soon.

Now her parents are very strict Christians. I'm atheist and she's pantheist, so we don't hold the same ideals. However they are extremely against living together before marriage and really controlling on this aspect. She doesn't want to tell them before she moves out, but they want to be involved in the apartment search.

The likely scenario is after we move in together, her whole family stops talking to her for a few years. That's exactly what happened to every other sibling that did the same thing, and she said she would be devastated and wants to wait to say anything for as long as possible. Any suggestions?
TL;DR:
