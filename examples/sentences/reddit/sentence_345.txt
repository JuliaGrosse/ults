TITLE: Crazy upcoming month
POST: I've been training for my first half marathon since January. I'll be running the mainly series at Clinton Iowa first week of June. Really looking forward to it. So far my longest run has been 11 miles at a pace I'd be happy to run the half at. I plan to run a full 13 this weekend.  

While I look forward to my half marathon, what has me more nervous is pacing my friend toward the end of his upcoming 100k ultra. I'll be running with him from mile 43 to 54. His pace is regularly much faster than mine but this will be his first 100k and has asked me to pace him for that section. His wife will take over for the last 9 miles. 

I've run this distance before and I'm not too worried about pace, he will have just ran 43 miles and will likely be running at a comfortable pace for me by that point. My biggest fear right now is the terrain. From what I hear, gravel with super gnarly hills.  I find myself now training more for this pacing challenge than for my half marathon.  

I'm excited, but nervous. Don't want to end up hindering his first 100k.  Should be a super interesting month ahead.  Any good tips?
