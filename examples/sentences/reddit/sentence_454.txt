TITLE: My [20F] Husband [26M] called me an ethnic slur.
POST: I'm White Hispanic. My maternal grandmother immigrated to the US from Mexico as a little girl. (This is relevant.)

A few days ago my husband called me his "sweaty little wetback" in the shower. Having a bit of a temper (also relevant in a bit) I snapped back that he was a "pasty ass cracker". 

I don't normally have any prejudice against white people, I just wanted to show him how hateful slurs can be, but of course he just laughed it off. And then of course I felt bad even though he wasn't offended in the slightest.

I got out of the shower hurt and confused. Why would he call me that? Is that how he sees me? A "wetback"?

Cue existential crisis over the course of the next three days: Do I even really count as Hispanic though? I mean my grandfather and father are %100 white. But I'm not white either because my grandmother *literally* came from Mexico!

Suddenly, everything I did I saw in the context of my ethnicity. Was I acting too Hispanic? Was I not being Hispanic enough? 

Finally, I exploded in a ball of confused emotion. I tried to be calm and rational and even started with an "I statement":

 It really hurt my feelings being called a wetback. *Cue tears and snot fountain* And I've tried to talk to you about it, but you just say it was just a joke, but it *wasn't* just a joke to me, it really hurt! And I feel like all you see is my skin...

At which point he interrupted me by putting our arms next to each other and saying how he had no idea it hurt me *that* bad and it was stupid and he shouldn't have said it. 

But I'm still hurting and feeling a little alone.
