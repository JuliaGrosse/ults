TITLE: my boyfriend(16) stopped calling me (f16) but still wants us to be together
POST: So I have been seeing this guy for about four months now. Usually he has been sorta clingy and calls or texts at least once a day. Lately however, he has stopped, It has progressed over the last couple of weeks to no calls at all. I have been the one to call. So i thought It was over and called to make it official yesterday. (these things happen for teens) However, he continued to chat like everything was normal before I could bring up the breakup. He sat there like normal and talked about us being together further on, told me he loved me and missed me the other night, he said I was cute, we talked and he was being an overall great boyfriend like everything was normal. I realized he was like this when I called, he just stopped calling like he used to. I am so confused right now. I know if I tried again he would be caught off guard and would continue to try to get me back. What is going on?!
TL;DR:
