TITLE: [16/m] Broke up with my [16/f] long-distance girlfriend.
POST: OK, so here's the deal. About a month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, we were doing the whole long-distance thing. In the moment I was completely taken by emotions,(hormones too.) and I told her how much I cared for her, even told her I loved her.(First time I've ever said that to a girl.) In response, she told me she didn't feel the same anymore, and she just wanted to be friends.

She had started to become distant weeks before, and I knew it wasn't working... Anyway, several days ago, she sent me a email, asking to talk on Skype. So I accepted, and the next day we talk. All she wanted to do was have small talk. I was fairly offended, and cut her off, and logged off. At this point, I'm not really sure what I should do next. And I was hoping Reddit could give me some ideas, or whatever.
TL;DR:
