TITLE: What was the most random thing you've ever done?
POST: Last year (my final year of college) my friend and I were sitting around having a beer after spending countless hours in the engineering building. We realized mardi gras was currently going on and figured a). we had nothing to do this weekend and b). when would be ever be able to pick up and go again.

We mapquested "New Orleans, LA" and made the 19 hour drive (departing from Michigan State University) and arrived about 7pm on Friday. Met a very nice couple who ironically had graduated from MSU (saw our shirts) and they gave us a mini-rundown. Friday night ended up staying out at the bar until 8am because we had no place to sleep. Ended up taking a couple hour power nap in the car, woke up, and did it all again. When 2am rolled around we once again slept in the car and set alarms for 7am. Woke up, made the drive back, and still made it to my 8am on Monday.

Was honestly the most fun I've ever had in a weekend.
TL;DR:
