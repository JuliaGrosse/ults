TITLE: TIFU by rocking out too hard to some Foo Fighters.
POST: This happened last night at a bar with some friends. 

We were enjoying a typical Friday night. Pregamed the bars with some brews and wine, BS'd and what not. Went to one of the Friday night bars in town, which is within walking distance of about 3 other bars that are always packed on Fridays. We were getting ready to leave the first bar, our group of about 5 standing by the door waiting for my girlfriend to come back from the restroom. I hear, very faintly, Dave Grohl's beautiful voice through the chaos of a packed bar. He's saying "I've got another confession to make!" If you've heard this song (and who hasn't?), you know there's no instrumentals going on while Dave belts out the opening line.  Then, there's some faint guitar in the background, but not enough to really hear over a noisy bar scene. But then, oh then, there's the magnificent "I needed somewhere to hang my head" and the full instrumental "drop." Basically, it's a classic headbanging moment. Which is where I fucked up..

Because nobody but me heard the song, I was the only one to react to this part, headbanging rather intensely. One headbang is all it took. Next thing I know, it feels like somebody stabbed me in the eye with a hot steak knife. I clutch my face and turn around, run into the wall, and just scream. 

Turns out, I handbanged right into my friends hand, specifically, her thumb, who happened to be raising it at that exact moment. Now it looks like I got punched square in the eye because it's black and blue and there's a cut underneath it. I've had to explain to everyone who has seen me today that I rocked out a little too hard to the Foo. 

Which is kind of badass in it's own right.
TL;DR:
