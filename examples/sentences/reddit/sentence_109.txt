SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [26 F] with my bf [38 M] dating for 4 months and i think he might be depressed and i'm confused HELP!
POST: Long time lurker and finally had the courage to post as my introvert self cannot make sense of anything as i'm clouded with emotion.

So he said that he loves me early. (from his culture this is normal, i took it as he likes me a lot so i don't have a big issue about it). He has a kid and lives with the kid when we started dating, everything was good, i didn't had problems with it as he is giving me enough time and attention. recently he gave up the kid to the ex wife (legal issues) and they aren't divorced yet, the kid will live with the mom but he will still  be able to take her from time to time. 

He never wanted to talk about these issues with me as he doesn't want to drag me to his problems, but from time to time i make him open up. The problem is this affected him so much and he said that it depresses him so much. I was a bit surprised cause in my background, guys dont have much dependencies on living with kids.
 
what bothered me alot  is that he told me he is now uncertain of what will happen to his life. and yet he asked me to move in with him just few weeks before all this happens. It made me feel that he might be using me to just escape from what depresses him. I wanna be with someone who really wanted to be with me and not bec he is depress and needy. 

Should i be more patient and wait til he got used to living without the kid or is this a sign that i should end things soon.
TL;DR:
