POST: Hi Lose It!

So I'm male, low 20's., and 5 foot 10. Used to way 260ish -- now 185ish. I have been "stable" (+/-) a few pounds for 1.5 years. 

I only do cardio. Always scared of the weights, don't know how to do them, don't/can't get a gym membership. I now will try weights, and this is where you come in.

I have a dumbbell set, and some open space, and that's basically it. Can anyone suggest some exercises/routines of what I should be doing with my very very limited supply of weights? Again no room for a bench press and shit like that. 

What I'm looking for is links to videos on YouTube etc...where I can throw them up on my computer and do the exercise while they are doing the exercise in my room....that way I can't "learn" and do things properly in the comfort of my own house.

I also plan to continue 45-60 minute cardio 5-6 times/week (post-dumbbells). Any help is appreciated.
TL;DR:
