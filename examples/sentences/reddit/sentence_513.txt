SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [18M] with my clingy Ex [18F] that lasted 1 month, just broke up a week ago. Don't know if break up was justified.
POST: We are both 18 and in college, and live in the same dorm complex (not the same rooms though). I broke up with her because I felt like we went WAY too fast and she had way too much emotional attachment (there was a point at which I didn't feel attracted to her even). I didn't feel like she would change her clingy-ness much at the time.

However, after a week of breakup, I've been reconsidering if she can change. Maybe it's just me missing her attention, or that I don't like being alone, but I'm now unsure if I overreacted about her emotional attachment and clingy-ness.

What do you think /r/relationships? Should I reconsider the breakup or stick with my decision?
TL;DR:
