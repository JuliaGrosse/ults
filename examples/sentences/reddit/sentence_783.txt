TITLE: TIFU by popping pills in a club
POST: So like with most of these this didn't happen today, but I had another fuck up today that reminded me of this one. It was so painful I must have blocked it from my memory. 
About a year ago my friend and I used to take MDMA pills, or Molly, and my body reacted to this by having to take a massive dump about a half hour afterwards. I had gotten pretty good with my timing, so I was able to get it out of my system before going out. Well, one night we were out at a club and we had been drinking when she offered me some. My drunk self forgot about the pill poops and took it. Fast forward a half hour later and right on cue I needed a bathroom, quick. After waiting 20 minutes to use the girls bathroom I finally make it into one of the two stalls and all is right with the world. I felt bad about stinking up the place, but it had to be done. I go to flush, and the fucking toilet won't flush. No matter what I tried it just wouldn't go down. I just wrecked half the girls bathroom. In a panic I run out, grab my friend, and sprint out of the club before explaining why we needed to leave.
TL;DR:
