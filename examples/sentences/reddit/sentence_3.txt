TITLE: Me [25F], Him [32 M] 2 1/2 years -- How do you thank someone who has been taking care of you when you're ill?
POST: About two weeks I broke my leg. My boyfriend has been kind enough to let me inhabit his couch/apartment until I'm well enough to climb up the stairs to my own apartment (no elevator in the building). I can't even really go out and hop around on crutches because I sprained my wrist in the accident too and crutches wear me out fast because they get too painful.

However, I am feeling increasingly more terrible about this. He has a very stressful job and trains for triathlons as well. He doesn't really have the time or energy to be dealing with me, but he's treated me with nothing but kindness and compassion to my every whim. He does SO MUCH for me!! Cooks me food, sacrifices his couch/privacy, lugs me to and from doctor's appointments, gets me water, gets me stuff from the store, checks my mail back at my apartment, keeps me company, comforts me when I'm depressed and upset about all this... today he is cooking me a favorite meal for my birthday...

I try to keep up being courteous to him and everything, and try to be as thankful as possible to him. But sometimes I just get grouchy and stir crazy with being kept indoors and I am not as nice with him as I could be. After I snap at him or I'm cold to him, I feel absolutely terrible about it, like right now. 

Anyway, the point I'm trying to arrive at, is how on EARTH do you EVER even BEGIN to thank someone for all of this??? Like.... holy crap, we're not even married and he's doing all of this for me. How will I ever repay his kindness? how CAN I?? Does anyone else have experience with this type of situation or know someone that does? I feel so guilty and lucky and awful and thankful.
TL;DR:
