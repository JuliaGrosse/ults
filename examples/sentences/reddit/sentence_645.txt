SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [27M] have moments where I am a complete dick and otherwise terrible person to my GF [22F]. I need advice.
POST: I'll keep this as condensed as I can.

I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half. For the most part, things are great. We're supportive of each other, healthy sex life, she's one of my best friends and I share everything with her.

I graduated in May and have been unable to get out of my current job. I've been working retail the past 8 years to put myself through school. Anyway, this job and not moving on in life gets to me. There are times where I treat my girlfriend like complete trash, say nasty and hurtful things that push her away.  Then wake up the next morning sick to my stomach with regret and am completely ashamed of what I said out of anger. I tend to be laid back and patient but lately I've been lashing out.

This has happened about 3 times now including last night. I don't know exactly what the cause is other than overwhelming feelings of frustration at times. And the one person I love most gets the brunt of it. 

She perhaps isn't as supportive as I might want, not for lack of empathy but she's busy with school and work. That's all understandable (now, in my level-headedness). But that adds to my frustration. The hardest part is the vast majority of our relationship is spent texting (can't live together because of family).

For the record, I've never touched her in these moments, in fact this stuff only happens through texting (we live about 40 minutes apart). In person, 

I love her dearly, but this NEEDS to stop. She doesn't deserve these outbursts and in all honesty I'm surprised she hasn't left yet. I need help, advice, anything you guys have. Maybe past experiences to draw from. Maybe other subreddits that I can check out. If I forgot anything or you need more details, I'll check it out when I get to work.
TL;DR:
