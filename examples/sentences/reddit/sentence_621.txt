TITLE: My long time crush(29/m) is single, and I(27/f) WANT HIM.
POST: K, so I've had a bit of a crush on this guy for quite a while. He broke up with a girlfriend about 6 months ago, but before I could make my intentions clear (like, before his ex gf moved out) he started seeing someone else. Thats cool, hes a good guy and I value his friendship but I'm not prepared to pine for him.

Then like a month later he was engaged. Yeah. Anyway, in the last week he's broken up with his fianc√©e, and is available again, (yay!) but has said he wants a good long break before his next relationship, and I agree he needs one. I'm willing to be patient. (I really don't want to be a rebound. see above where I value his friendship.)

But he got snatched up so quickly last time, he really is quite a catch. I'm worried I'll miss the window of opportunity. 

So what do I do? I'm tempted to take him aside, kiss the fuck out of him, and tell him to give me a call when he's next ready for a relationship. But that could get awkward and weird. I suspect he wants a fuck buddy relationship, and my hypothalamus is screaming at me that that's a terrible idea. I've loved someone who didn't feel the same way before, and its not fun. 

We're both in the poly/kinky group of our little city, neither of us want a monogamous relationship, (I've been in quite a few, its hard, but fun) so ironically enough, if he was still with someone else I wouldn't worried about my feelings, but the fact that he's single and *available* for a proper romantic relationship... my lizard brain is telling me "there be dragons." HELP MEEEEEEEE!
TL;DR:
