TITLE: What advice can you give me on finding a new job?
POST: Ok so I've been working for the same company since I was 16.  I started as a bagger at this grocery store named Kash N' Karry.  Since then I've transferred to their warehouse.  

So to the point, the company has been going through bad times and it's closed many stores, last quarter it actually made a profit and our parent company has sold the brand to another company; but the warehouse was not a part of that sale and in six months I will be losing my job. 

During my time with the company I attempted school.  I wanted more than anything to be an animator.  I dabbled in drawing but I've never felt like I was very good.  I know a lot of artist say this but to this day I'm horrible at drawing from imagination.  I used to be very skilled at drawing what I saw in front of me but it has been many years since I've done that and I'm basically at square one with that skill.  School sadly did not work out for me, I've never been diagnosed, but I believe I suffer from ADHD based on the symptoms, which made school difficult and I suffered depression because at the time I just thought I was a loser who couldn't get his act straight.  (And maybe that was and still is the case.)

I need to find a new job but my problem is that I don't have many skills I feel will help me with finding one, especially one that doesn't involve flipping burgers.  I'm not above doing that but I would like to try to find a better job before I take one that will severely cut my pay, which I honestly can't afford.  So if the wonderful people of reddit could give me some advice I would appreciate it.  I know more information will be needed in order to provide good advice and I will be glad to provide more details as you guys need them.
