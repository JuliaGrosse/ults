TITLE: My [25F] boyfriend [35M] of 3 years has suddenly begun to sound exactly like my ex, same tone of voice and all
POST: I haven't seen my ex, Dane, for 4 years, and we haven't had any contact whatsoever. One weekend I'm visiting my parents and my mom lets slip that he's married now, with a baby, and I get curious and decide to look him up on facebook. I find out all kinds of horrible things about him (abusive wife, homeless, sick baby, no hair) and I regret ever looking him up in the first place.

That night, my current boyfriend, Jay, gives me a call, and wouldn't you know it, he drops the *exact* same not-so-common catchphrase, in the same tone of voice, that Dane used to use when he'd call me. They sounded so eerily similar that I can't even respond for a bit, half of my brain is thinking Dane somehow got my new number and called me up. Throughout the conversation I'm completely distracted by the fact that Dane's voice would suddenly crop up and drop another phrase--and it did, several times. And Jay and Dane *do not* inherently sound alike.

I try to ignore it, but after a week of this I can't stand it anymore and I ask Jay if he's noticed that he's begun to talk differently. He says no, but I swear to god he *did not* used to sound like that. Jay and Dane don't know each other, they've never met, and Dane doesn't have an internet presence or a particularly distinctive voice (no goofy accent that Jay would unwittingly put on to be funny). I don't know how this could happen or what to do about it, every time I talk to Jay it's getting clearer, it's gotten to the point where I've started putting off calling him just to avoid that fucking stupid voice he's begun to make. It enrages me. How am I supposed to deal with this? Has anyone else gone through this?
TL;DR:
