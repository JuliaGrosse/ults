SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [27F] met a guy [36M] I actually really like and we've been talking for a short while. I'm relationship naive and want to know if I should be straightforward or patient with his seeming lack of interest
POST: He seems like a really nice guy and I'm pretty into him. We met online, but have yet to meet in person despite talking for about a week. He comes off really reserved, a military guy, and he struck me as different because he was the only guy I met from from this online thing who *wasn't* 1) only looking to just to seeing what happens 2) or avoiding something serious. He seems to really want to find something substantial. 

The problem is his signals are strange. I compliment him a lot when I rarely ever do that. I flirt a bit. I initiated talking offline in text and phone chatting. I feel like I'm giving way too much effort thinking that maybe he is shy or a little guarded. I don't really know what I'm doing or what to look for, but I feel like he should sometimes say "you look pretty" when I send pics or be trying to get closer to me. He just seems really passive despite saying he's got his fingers crossed with me and he's happy we're forming a connection. I backed off of texting today because he was giving me nothing even though we had a really good convo last night, but then he told me "text me whenever, I always have my phone on me" and wanted me to add him to Facebook. I'm confused.

I was thinking of just asking him "are you into me or not really feeling it because it kind of seems like you're not really feeling it", but I don't know if I should do that or just go silent or do something else. I'm really scared of investing time in yet another jerk. I have never met a guy who was genuinely interested in me besides trying to score a one night stand and it just hurts. I want to find someone who has some sort of passion towards me.
TL;DR:
