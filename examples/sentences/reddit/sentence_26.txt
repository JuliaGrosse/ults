TITLE: Me [25 M] with my GF [25 F] of 11 months, lied about sexual history, didnt tell me her EX was diagnosed with herpes... I'm not angry?
POST: Me and my GF have been going out for around 11 months. When we first got together i asked her how many partners she had in the last year. She said 1, her ex. We then had sex without a condom based on this information. She got tested a month later and had chlamydia. I never tested positive. She told me her EX must have cheated.

9 months later I snooped on her and connected dots to figure out that she had another "fling" while things with her old BF were fizzling. Completely understandable, however she hid this from me because she thought i would "think less of her". This is where she got the chlamydia. I'm of the mindset that your past doesn't matter - what matters to me is that i made a decision based on a small set of information and was lied to.

While i was snooping i also found a text from her EX (from ~2 weeks earlier; so 10 months after they broke up) telling her that he had herpes but has since had other girls she he was letting her know and possibly blaming her - she didn't even think to tell me and she didn't even think to get tested.  I was pretty upset by this and made her get tested, her test is today.

Anyway - I cant help but think that i should break up with her over these two things. However, i'm honestly not "mad" at her. I just feel like the trust has be set back a fair bit. Is my reaction wrong/irrational? I really do love this girl, but shes also my first major relationship so I may have "first love" syndrome or some shit. Just looking for unbiased opinions.
TL;DR:
