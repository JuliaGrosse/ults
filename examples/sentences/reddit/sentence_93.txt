TITLE: Issues with my father
POST: Since I was very young My father [49] has been very emotionally abusive to myself M [17] and my family (Mother [48] and sisters [16] and [12]). I grew up with a lot of self esteem problems. Basically when we did things wrong as children, rather than using things like "time outs" he would resort to belittling us, and telling us how worthless we were. As I got older my self-esteem and social skills have improved so much thanks to some terrific people in my life. As my self-esteem has grown, my relationship with my father is become rather bitter. We fight constantly, and while neither of us really hold a grudge it's never really resolved either  making each fight much worst than the last. I used to try to be the bigger person and apologize for upsetting him(usually when I did nothing wrong), but that never got me anywhere other than   him acting as though he deserved more than my apology. I'm pretty laid back person, but when ever he talking down to me, or even worse  my mom or my sisters it enrages me. I think of all the years of low self-esteem and depression I went through. The hard thing is, he isn't some heartless monster. He loves us a lot, and he gets really upset after he hurts us. I really want to help him, but I don't know how to get through to him.
TL;DR:
