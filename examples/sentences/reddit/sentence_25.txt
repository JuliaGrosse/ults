SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My son (12M w/Aspergers) can be... difficult. My husband of 1 yr (35M) gets angry, loses his temper. I'm (38F) at a loss.
POST: Husband and I have been together for 2 years, married for 1. He's very sweet to me and we have a pretty good relationship. Arguments are infrequent, but a constant source of tension is his relationship with my kids.

He's always found it difficult to relate to my kids (10M, 12M), but moreso with my eldest because my eldest is not an easy child to deal with. He's just been diagnosed with Aspergers (something I'd suspected since he was a toddler, but that's another story). He can be whiney and doesn't let things go, which just comes off as spoiled. Except for a speech impediment, he appears totally neurotypical. 

So, on to the reason for my post -- I just need a sanity check. 

Tonight, we'd planned to take the kids with us to a party and it so happened that no other kids would be present. The kids were going to hang out and play
