SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me (17M) just broke-up with my GF(17F) of 6months. Feeling confused and lost.
POST: Met this girl at school 6 months ago. I asked her out after leading a strong friendship with her. 

Background info: She regularly went to parties and clubs where she would get drunk. I have never been to a party or gotten drunk. We lead different lifestyles. However, we were really close.

The break-up: About two weeks ago she began acting odd in my company, not going in for hugs and not wanting to go out as much. We haven't had any form of sexual contact (I'm still a virgin) but we were planning on having intercourse in the near future. 2 days ago she texted me out of the blue saying that we had to chat. She says that she doesn't feel like she is ready for a relationship and that she is sorry. I asked why and she went on a rant about how her ex hurt her and she is scared it will happen again. I said that i understood and agreed that we wont be seeing each other anymore.

Why am I writing this?: i don't know what to do. I used to speak to her daily, I'm feeling a little lonely and hurt by it all. She is going out clubbing on Monday night with her friends and i feel that maybe there is a reason underlying the break up other than what was said. I want to move on but there is a little voice saying i gave in too easy and just let her go when I shouldn't have. I don't know what to do.
TL;DR:
