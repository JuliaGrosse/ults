TITLE: Where are you from/where do you currently live?  How do you like/dislike the way of life that your area provides for you?
POST: I'm from a suburb about 6 miles outside of Boston, and I recently moved about 100 miles west to Amherst to finish school.  Growing up outside of Boston, there are a lot of wealthy, privileged kids who try and act hard and tough as if they grew up with problems or something. Also everyone in my area started drinking and doing drugs way earlier than other people I've met from other places, for example I started drinking, smoking and smoking pot at 12.  

Western Massachusetts is much different, as it is far less densely populated, and aside from the two flourishing college towns, and Springfield, ma (americas's stinkiest armpit besides maybe Detroit) most towns are very small farm towns. Everyone who lives in my college town is either a student or a super liberal hippie person. There is a fair amount of scuzzy looking people around town, but they generally keep to themselves and don't pose much of a threat.  Everyone in town seems to smoke a lot of weed, and the town government doesn't seem to care much about that, as they hold a giant weed fest in town every year called "extravaganja" where they ask the police to look the other way completely.
TL;DR:
