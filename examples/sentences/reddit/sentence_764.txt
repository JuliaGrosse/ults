TITLE: Me [25 F] with my nice neighbor [30s F] of a few months, how do I get her to stop smoking in her driveway?
POST: Hi there, any advice would be much appreciated! My neighbors (a couple in their 30s with a toddler) moved in a few months ago. They are a huge upgrade from my previous neighbor, who made it her personal mission to make sure nobody parked on our street. Anyways, all is fine with these neighbors; they're quiet, friendly, and normal in general. I don't talk to them much, just a simple "hello" or "how are you?" if we bump into each other outside.

However, the woman smokes in her driveway every few hours, every day, and it blows in through my side patio door right into my dining room where I spend a lot of time working or just hanging out. She obviously has every right to smoke on her property, but I have tons of allergies so having my house smell like cigarette smoke every few hours isn't great for me. 

Is there any way I can go about addressing this issue with her without ruining our friendly/hands-off neighborly relationship? Do I have any right to ask her to smoke elsewhere? I really don't want to inconvenience her, and I'm sure she has no idea her smoke is blowing into my house, but I'm not sure how much longer I can put up with my house smelling like smoke.
TL;DR:
