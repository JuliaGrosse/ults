TITLE: TIFU by going to court
POST: This happened when I was a wee lad but remembered it from a recent askreddit post. Figured I'd share here. 

I tagged along with my dad to court, so he could fight some sort of ticket he had gotten. Anywho I was about 7 years old at the time and had to take a massive dump, but being the curious 7 year old that I was, I didn't want to leave so I could witness how exactly this court stuff worked. Well me and my dad were on the second to last row in the courtroom waiting for my dads trial or whatever, the last row is where all the cops sit, and beside me is another guy waiting for his court sentence. Now this guy beside me had obviously been waiting for awhile as he was completely passed out. About half an hour passes waiting for my dad to plead his case, when all of a sudden my gut starts to fill up with the gas of a thousand demons. 7 year old me doesn't think twice and I release it in all it's glory. 
The long wooden benches we were sitting on reverberated the fart 10 fold. It was so loud it stopped the court from proceeding and in the midst of all the laughter and chaos, 2 cops sitting behind me grab the guy who was passed out beside me, and toss him out of court. They had apparently thought he was the one who farted lol. 
My dad knew it was me but told me to be proud as he said it made the judge laugh whom was apparently a hard ass. That ladies and gents is my fart story.
TL;DR:
