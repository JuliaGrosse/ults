TITLE: So I got an interview regardless of not having experience and they say experience is a must...
POST: I feel like I'm being given a huge opportunity here. I applied to a sales/csr postion because I had the customer service experience and I got an email back with the generic, "we're sorry" message because I had no sales experience.

Well apparently I did a very good job of writing a convincing email back and not giving up. I effectively sold myself in the email and later on the phone so they gave me the last available slot they had for an interview.

My question is, with no sales experience outside of probably selling my car, how can I land this job? I'm nervous as to what kind of questions they'll ask and how I can not sound like a huge buffoon when I have to reiterate to the supervisor that I have no professional sales experience.
TL;DR:
