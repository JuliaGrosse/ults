TITLE: I (23m) get irrationally anxious and stressed during/after arguments with my girlfriend (19f)... How can I work on this?
POST: My (23M) girlfriend (19F) and I have been seeing each other for around 5 - 6 months, official for 3. We have arguments, just like any couple. My problem is that I get incredibly anxious and stressed after an argument and find it hard to function normally. For example, we had an argument last night, but we made up before bed and everything seemed okay. 

Today at work my anxiety is going crazy, I can't concentrate and I've completely lost my appetite. I have a history of anxiety issues, but it's never been this bad in past relationships. The thing is, I'm not entirely sure what it is that I'm worried about exactly. Maybe it's that if she's still mad at me and the argument starts up again, I can't be with her and talk to her in person and we'd have to talk through texts until I finish work. Also, the thought of possibly getting no response from said texts and being ignored might be part of the issue. I'm not worried about her doing anything stupid or cheating or anything.

I know in my head that these feelings are irrational, and that arguments are a normal part of every healthy relationship, but I just can't shake these feelings. I know my girlfriend loves me and she's told me that she would never leave me, and I believe that. If anyone has any words of wisdom, that would be much appreciated.
