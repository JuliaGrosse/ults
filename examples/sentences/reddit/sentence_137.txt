TITLE: I [19F] lent my bass guitar to my now ex-boyfriend [22M]. I'd like it back, but he's ignoring me.
POST: A couple weeks before we broke up, I lent my now ex-boyfriend my bass guitar so he could record a song (it's a nice bass and he's always loved playing it). He lives two hours away from me, so after the break-up we planned on meeting before one of his weekly choir practices, which is half way between us, so he could give it back.

Three months later, I don't have it. We've planned on meeting many times, but he's cancelled each one. Now, I haven't even heard from him in weeksâ€”he hasn't answered my calls, he's blocked me on Facebook, he doesn't log into Skype, and didn't answer me when I messaged him via his music page on Facebook. Instead, he posted a status about all the cool bass lines he's been writing.

As you can imagine, I'm quite frustrated. I know he had a hard time with us breaking up, but it's been months and he's still acting like a kid. I've never been in this position; what's the appropriate way to handle this? Threaten to get police involved? Call his mom? I don't want to be a crazy ex-girlfriend.
TL;DR:
