TITLE: I'm a not so smooth 19M currently crushing on a 17F and need some advice
POST: As the title says I'm not smooth in any way with women, talking with them occasionally turns awkward and I usually run out of things to say. So I'm looking for advice on how I should start a conversation with this girl, continue it, and leave her wanting to talk to me again. So far every time we've talked (we talk on Facebook) I've began the conversations, and they've ended kind of abruptly, usually with her either not replying or her giving an awkward "later." Is this her saying "give me some room and don't talk to me so much," or am I just being paranoid? I would also like to know what signs to look for if there are any obvious ones, like ones that I should take as a sign to leave her alone, or ones that spell out "ask me out already" in mysterious girl talk.
TL;DR:
