TITLE: Can My Boss Do This?
POST: Background:
 I work for a corporate coffee shop in California as a supervisor. (i.e. Starbucks, Pete's, and Coffee Bean) My boss is not the best at scheduling people. He tends to schedule people on days they have submitting to him in writing that they can't work. Forced people to come in and work even though they have a 102 fever, and a few other things I can't come up with.

Problem:
 I have planed a trip where I am leaving Wednesday to go out     of the state. I have requested off time for the trip a month ago, at the time my boss told me there would be no problem. Last Wednesday my boss distributed the schedule for this week and had me not scheduled for my tip, But just today (Monday around 5 pm) he told me that I need to find someone to cover one of the shifts that I would normally work. I am worried he is going to tell me if I don't find someone to cover it then I would have to work it. I was wondering if there is a law that prevents this, because I spent a lot of money on the trip that I would lose if I don't go.
TL;DR:
