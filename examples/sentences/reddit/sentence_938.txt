TITLE: Have been waiting weeks to hear back from a company I interviewed for. What should I do next?
POST: Hi Everyone!

First and foremost, thank you all for great content that helps the wonderful people of this sub educate themselves and eventually land jobs. I am similar to most of you (100+ applications, limited callbacks, still striving!) and have a question. 

I applied for a company about six weeks ago and got an email stating they wanted a phone interview (recruiter screening). After I completed the initial interview, I was passed on to the hiring manager for another phone interview. I was then asked to come in for a interview. After the interview, I asked the HR/Recruiter when I should expect to hear back about the position and was told it would be roughly 5 days. 

It has now been a little over three weeks since the interview and still nothing. I have emailed the recruiter twice since then, and each time he says "We still have not made a decision. I will know more in a week." The week then goes by and I hear nothing. 

Now, I know for a fact they were still (and probably still are) interviewing more candidates. Are they just stringing me along because they don't want to close the door on a potential candidate? Should I just take this as they are trying to get someone with better qualifications than me? 

I was supposed to get a response on Friday of last week and never got one. I'm not sure if I should keep going with this and do ANOTHER follow up, or if I should just take it as I was not the best fit and send a thank you letter. 

Any help would be great as to what my next move should be. Thanks a lot in advance.
TL;DR:
