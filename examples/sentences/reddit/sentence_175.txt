SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My girlfriend (21F) dumped me a few days ago. I (21F) am currently fluctuating between seething anger and depression-like apathy. How do I get on with my life ASAP?
POST: Not much to say. Almost 2 year relationship down the drain. I got dumped on Friday and I felt almost fine for the entire weekend, but yesterday/today I was bouncing around between being furious and not giving a single fuck. I spent the whole weekend doing whatever I wanted to do so I could feel better, and I exercise 40-60 minutes daily. I'm eating healthy foods and getting enough sleep.

I already got rid of everything my ex ever gave to me, and I deleted all pictures/social media stuff. I will not be contacting her ever again, or any of our mutual friends for at least a few months. I guess I just don't know what else I can do to move on. I know some of this shit takes time, but I would like to do anything else that might help while I wait because I hate the overload of angry emotions and the complete lack of feeling that I'm dealing with right now.

Also, my boobs have been hurting badly since the breakup. Hormones? Vengeful breasts? Why me, boobies?
TL;DR:
