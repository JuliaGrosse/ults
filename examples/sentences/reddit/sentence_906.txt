TITLE: Recitified cervical and pinched nerves.
POST: Hello guys, I'ma  30 yo male, in the past month I started to feel very dizzy and with nausea all day.

I had a couple of syncope episodes when I was a kid, and after years of study, the doctors came to the conclusion that those episodes were gone for sure.

Until a couple of days ago, when I was in the bathroom, and suddenly I started to feel all the pre syncope symptoms. The only thing I remember, is waking up on the floor with a broken nose and blood coming from my head.

After a lot of studies, the doctors are telling me that my heart is healthy but I have some pinched nerves on my cervical, including the vagus nerve. And that is causing all these nausea, pre syncope feelings, and heart rate problems.

So my question is, can I trust this? Are this episodes going to go away after the kinesiology threatment? I've heard ffrom a lot of people with muscular pain derived from a rectified cervical, but never heard of people constantly fainting and feeling like sh** all day thanks to this.

Thanks in advance.
TL;DR:
