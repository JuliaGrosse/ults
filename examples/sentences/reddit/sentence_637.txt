SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [25M] with guy I'm dating [21 M] 3 months, doesn't want anything serious but actions confusing
POST: He said he is not looking for anything serious. He's only been single after two year relationship since May 2015. Said relationships are 'draining'. 
We hang out once a week. I wish it to be more. 
He only ever really comes to mine when he is "free". Never any real urgency about wanting to see me when we could after work. It's always gotta be when we both aren't working the next day so he can stay over. I wouldn't mind going to his house for a dinner? 

We do dates like hikes, museums etc
We have sex. 
He texts me every night asking how my day was. 
This usually follows with a "I miss you" text from him. 

He's met my friends and I'm thinking I haven't met his. 
Do I need to back off a bit in this regard? Stop showing him off as if he were my boyfriend?

He's never actually said "I like you". 
I have once. 

I wanna let my guard down and get close to him but I can't help feel I'm just something he is using to pass the time by. Which will crush me. 

I have so much fun with him and when he leaves I'm left wondering when I'll see him again. I want a relationship where plans are made as we say goodbye.
TL;DR:
