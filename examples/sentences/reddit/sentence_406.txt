TITLE: I (F/22) need some help motivating my (M/27) boyfriend to drop some weight.
POST: We have been together over a year. He's probably 50lbs or so overweight, and it's all belly. I run 5ks, I'm training for my first Triathlon next month so I am always doing something to help us try and motivate each other. For the past 6 months we have eaten quite healthy- low carbs, whole grains, quinoa or brown rice, lots of vegetables, mostly lean ground chicken or turkey and lots of salad, beans, ect. 

We never order takeout, eat fast food, can't tell you the last time we had pizza, fried food, no pasta dishes or heavy sauces on anything. It's hard to notice if all these things we are doing have had any effect on him, he hasn't said much about his clothes fitting better, ect. 

He has two full time jobs A) Full Time Firefighter working 48 hours then off 96 B) He owns and maintains a landscaping business that has 50 accounts, working 10-12 hour days to get it all done on his 4 days off. 

Needless to say, I understand when he gets home he's tapped out exhausted and sometimes going for a walk/bike ride is the last thing he wants but where is this extra weight come from? Maybe he's binge eating at the firehouse? Or eating crappy food on his lawn breaks? I carefully told him that only he can make a change, I will support him and help as he wants me to but at the end of the day if he doesn't have the drive; I cannot force it and do it for him.

 It also concerns me, as we are quite a serious relationship that if we ever had kids they would think it is OK to be over weight, if that makes sense. Any advice?
