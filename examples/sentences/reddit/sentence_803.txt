TITLE: Another Update. My husband [36] walked out on me [33] on Monday after 13 years and I don't know what to do.
POST: Here was my last update, 10 days ago, the links to the other posts are in there:

This is just another brief update. My husband yesterday asked me to start divorce proceedings using his adultery as the reason. He says I can have the house and full custody if the children because he's moving to Belgium to be with his online girlfriend.
To be clear, in Northern Ireland to get a divorce a married couple has to be living apart for two years (it hasn't even been three months) before a divorce can occur with consent from both people. Without consent the separation has to be five years. The exceptions to this are unreasonable behaviour or adultery-there are others but I've not sure what they are. So he can't start divorce proceedings, but I can.

I'm completely amazed by this, he's throwing away his entire life for this woman he met online only 4 months ago, and has spent less than a week with in person, and that in London. He's never been to her country, her home, or met her child, yet he''s abandoning his own children to go raise someone else's. Not to mention he doesn't speak the language.

At this stage it feels like my husband has been replaced by a pod person, he so little resembles the man I married.
TL;DR:
