TITLE: Should I (M19) drop this girl (F20)...?
POST: Hello,

This girl I met has been hitting on me for a while and I'm interested. However, today she said something that really bothered me. I told her I can't really cook and have much to learn and she asked me in a b**chy way how am I supposed to impress a woman if I can't cook.... I told her I was joking ( I can cook but have limited knowledge.) but it was just so...direct and rude. She replied a little cold after that and I just ignored her... She's told me she can't do some things well and I never asked "How do you expect to impress a man?" Not everyone knows everything, and plus she told me she's a bad cook...(lol)

Just a little amazed she could be so rude...but what do you guys think? She's really cool, smart and I can talk to her like a bro but I feel like that attitude she displayed today while texting seems to foreshadow some "drastic" situations.
TL;DR:
