TITLE: So Reddit, I just got out of a one and a half + year(s) relationship. WTF happens now?
POST: Context: I turned 21 in February of this year, she will be turning 20 in August. I started dating this girl in September of 2009. Things went great at first, our puppy-love phase didn't end until April of 2010. Things eventually turned more'serious' and less lovey-dovey; we even took a trip to Europe together which was a first for both of us, neither of us had taken a trip with an SO before. 

Like any couple we had ups and downs but I was noticing that most of the downs happened because of her jealous and possessive attitude, but I decided to roll with it because I still liked her, a lot. Over the course of this winter things carried along rather nicely, a few bumps here and there, again mostly caused by her attitude.

Within the last month I realized I wasn't happy in the relationship and broke up with her this evening. I don't really know what I should be feeling, but I certainly don't feel relief or anything positive. I just feel like I lost someone who I once loved but who was weighing me down emotionally, which I consider to be unhealthy and unnecessary for me at this point in my life.
TL;DR:
