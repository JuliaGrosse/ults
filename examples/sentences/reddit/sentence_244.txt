TITLE: my long-distance non-binary partner (20) wants an open relationship and I (19F) don't
POST: So me and my partner have been together for about a year and a half (i think? but only 6 month of this was in person, the rest long-distance). I'm the first partner they've ever had, first kiss, first sexual partner etc. Since we're so far apart from each other we obviously both struggle with missing physical affection but they seem to struggle with it a LOT more than me, especially sex which im not particularly interested in a lot of the time. 

They brought up that they wanted to try an open relationship which i initially agreed to try but I soon realised i HATE the idea of my partner with someone else, and im thoroughly more comfortable with monogamy. 

Problem now is that they're saying they're starved for physical affection, they feel unwanted, not to mention depressed (although this has always been an issue for them). It even seems to me that they're not interested in me sexually and would rather sleep with some stranger, but they insist that they love me and want to be with me long-term and won't cheat on me blah blah.

I dont even know what im asking here just some general advice and good wishes i guess? Is it fair of me to demand monogamy when we're on opposite sides of the world for months at a time, especially when it seems to be making my partner unhappy?

they're not as shitty as i'm making them sound and they dont want to hurt me in any way, we love each other very much but this is causing a real issue at the moment.
TL;DR:
