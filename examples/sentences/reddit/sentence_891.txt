TITLE: Me [22/M] with my GF [22/F] of 8 months, are having communication issues.
POST: So here's some back-story. We have known each other for about 2 years before we started dating and have been together for a decent amount of time I wouldn't call it very long, but, i do really love this girl. We were not "officially" dating for quite some time i would say we have been "seeing each other" for 9 or 10 months. I'm not going to lie we have had a rocky start I was distant due to our history, I've been distant and she has been nothing but loving. She has had a few white lies here and there but nothing to really make me end it. I just got pretty upset and she did what she could and we were fine. 

Alright, as of now I have been deployed for 5 months with the military and for the first 4 months i was an ass. I was stressed with work, throwing it at her pushing her away when i should have noticed how much she actually tried. She finally hit her breaking point recently (3 weeks ago) with the stress of things at home and with her and I just adding to it. Honestly it was a 180 kick in the face for me. Since that day i have done nothing but try to talk to her as much as possible, but, it always seemed like i was a chore or she didn't want to deal with it. I blame myself for all of that, she did nothing. 

Now though we have begun to patch things up but it seems I'm still that chore. Almost as if we have swapped places (She is the one pushing and I'm the one holding on) i know much time has not passed but it seems it has turned into a "pissing game". I just want to move the relationship forward but i need her for that as well. I'm just not getting any reciprocity. Maybe she doesn't want to move forward or she is too stressed idk. She is still here she still talks im just not getting through to improve it.
TL;DR:
