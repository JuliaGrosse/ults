TITLE: Me [20M] broke up with my [18F] girlfriend of 3.5 years. Wondering how to deal with the loneliness.
POST: Ok, so I have posted about this before. My girlfriend and I split after she told me she was unhappy. Come to find out she had been talking to another guy for about a month before hand and kissed him at her sisters wedding. She had been telling me that we could try again down the road but after finding that out I told her I don't know if I would want to but maybe we could be friends.

 I have tried to be nothing but nice to her, I told her that I forgive her and that she doesn't need to feel guilty for feelings she can't control and the only mistake she mad was not telling me sooner. I then went on to say that there is still a place for her in my life as a friend if she would ever feel comfortable with that. I really wanted to keep things on good terms because our families are somewhat close and I still care about her. Unfortunately she never replied and now none of her family members will really talk to me. The last thing I heard from them was her mother telling me that my EX does not hate me. 

   I felt better after we initially broke up but now I find myself getting very lonely at times. It feels like half the people that cared about me have just sort of disappeared. I saw her post a picture of herself yesterday and she looked very happy. I just don't understand how someone can go from caring about someone to forgetting about them so quickly. I have tried to surround myself with friends for the most part but I always know at the end of the day its just going to me sitting alone in my room wishing I had someone to talk to :/
TL;DR:
