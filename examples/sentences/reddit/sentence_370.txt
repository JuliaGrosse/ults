TITLE: I can't, what, where? Fantasy land. I am out of the hole... do I go back in?
POST: Background: I have had credit since I was 18 years old, and have been in massive amount of debt twice since then. I was never late on payments and my credit score hasn't been hit that bad either. (I am high 600s, low 700s) Thankfully I am in the Army so it has made my idiotic mistakes easier to deal with.

I'm at the butt-end of a deployment and have successfully paid of all of my credit card debt again with one late reported payment (which is bullshit, but that's another story!) With my last few deployment paychecks I will be building a $6,000 emergency fund account with my fianc√©. It will be $3,000 from the each of us.

I also want a car as soon as I get back. I would ike to finance it through USAA just so I can get some installment debt on credit report (previous was a $1,000 loan I took out) and also because I don't want to spend the little I was able to save during this deployment was paying off my debt and seemingly starting at phase 1. I have a consistently paying job for the next year and a half too so that's a plus.

I have a high interest in investment as well but that's for another time...
TL;DR:
