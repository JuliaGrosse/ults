TITLE: Wife [28F] doesn't want me [30M] to play DOOM around our [5M] son
POST: Hi there,

I have gotten the new DOOM game recently and have been playing through it. I have gamed for most of my adult life and sometimes my wife's son (from a previous relationship, I'll call him Billy) will walk in on me playing. He likes the fast-paced nature of most of the games I play (mostly racing stuff) but he can't work the controllers yet.

Anyways, when I got the new DOOM my wife forbid me from playing it around Billy because it was too violent/scary. Billy doesn't see it as scary though (nor will he grow up to be an axe murderer because of this game) so I resent that I can't spend this time with Billy while we game. Also there's not much time during which I can game without Billy looking over my shoulder due to my weird work schedule. I don't see why I have to cut him out and get up at weird hours of the night to play this thing I spent my personal money on.

At this point it has become a big point of contention. She says I just need to suck it up and compromise for the sake of compromise but I don't see any point in kowtowing to her since I think she's in the wrong here.

How can we resolve this?
TL;DR:
