TITLE: Me [30F] with my boyfriend [30M] for a year, I am making myself suffer needlessly
POST: I am in a loving relationship, but am constantly worried it's going to turn bad or that he doesn't love me.  The thing is, he's never done anything to make me feel this way.   It's all coming from me and my insecurities about myself.  Sometimes, I think of worst case scenarios and I play it out as if it has happened.  I feel the emotions that would come as if it had happened.  Then I get sad.  

The thoughts I tend to play out are sad.  For example, my boyfriend having feelings for another person.  I make myself suffer needlessly.  And, I take it out on my boyfriend by asking about said thought and looking for reassurance.  He understandably gets upset and frustrated because he does love me and it's like saying I don't trust him.  I feel disoriented and like I have no perspective about how to live a normal healthy life without making myself suffer.  I guess my question is, what are some tools that I can use to correct my thought patterns.  I want peace of mind.  Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice you guys might have.
