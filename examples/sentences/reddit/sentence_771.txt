TITLE: I [25m] just broke it off with my gf [27f] after 1.25 years. I don't know how to feel.
POST: We always had problems, even during the honeymoon phase and i'm the only person who didn't see it.   Well my eyes are open now and my gf has done a lot of things to suggest that she's using me.   Such as, i won't move to NOLA for you, but i'll move to Seattle so "I can start a new life".   Good luck with that.   I couldn't even imagine starting a new life with her.   

I feel like i'm worth less to her than a dog.   If i'm not doing exactly what she wants me to do, she's just pouty and immature about it.   If i try to be myself, she ends up mad at me so easily.  Very intolerant.   Well I'm not changing who I am just to keep her happy.   I broke it off last night and it hurts so bad, but it's also relieving.   She definitely wasn't the one.   

I'm just... not sure... that i have the strength to not go back.  My brain is really good at talking me into it...
TL;DR:
