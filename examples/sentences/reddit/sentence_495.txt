SUBREDDIT: r/legaladvice
TITLE: Repost from Wlswhere: Reddit I have a legal question and I really need help on this one. Brother in trouble.
POST: Hey gang, So my beloved older brother has had a little trouble getting his life off the ground. He graduated college a couple years ago, and he's employed but he hates his job and desperately wants to move out of my parents house. Anyway, last weekend he was driving through NH with his buddy, smoking weed in his car, and he got stopped for speeding. The cop searched the car and found a couple grams of weed. So he's got a court date in June. So he wants to know what his prospects are. He really does not want this to appear on his permanent record, and obviously if he could afford an fancy lawyer, this would not even be an issue. So the question is, does he absolutely need a lawyer? Or is there might he be able to go to court and get a slap on the wrist without any permanent damage to his record? He's really strapped for cash. He's also never had any series infractions before. A few speeding tickets, but that's it. What should he do?
Thank you in advance. He called me for advice, and I had no idea what to tell him, but I said that I'd ask you people. He's unfamiliar with the wonders of Reddit.
TL;DR:
