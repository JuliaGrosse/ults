TITLE: Reddit, whats your long distance relationship story?
POST: I'm a sophomore at college, 6 hours away from school.
Started dating this girl my senior of high school. She commutes to school. We did well with video chatting and all my freshman year. She broke up with me in July, and we stopped talking until mid September. I went back home a few weeks ago and met back up with her. Had a great time. We agreed we can't be together because it just won't work at the moment, but we'll maintain a friendship and keep talking through our college years to see if things can work out after college.
TL;DR:
