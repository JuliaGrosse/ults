TITLE: Should I feel guilty...
POST: I've(30) been dating the same awesome girl(25) for something close to 2 years now and to be straight up, she's afraid of marriage and has made the statement that while she loves me, she's not sure if I'm "it" for her but doesn't want to break up because we have an awesome relationship and amazing times together. 

She's thought about us married and says she can see it working but is still scared that she, like many others, will reach that middle point of life and fall out of love or want something different. She's also thinking that maybe because of her marriage fear and the fact that before meeting me she didn't even want a relationship, it may just take her longer to know that she wants to marry someone. Her other friends have all been dating less time than us and already know where they are going, like they want marriage or they are moving in with each other and I feel like we're just spinning our wheels. I do feel jealous of her friends relationships, even though I know we have a good thing. 

She's also stated that she's moving in a year and we talked about me moving there after she's been there a few months but I feel like that's not really going happen. As such I think I've started to decide the relationship is already over and begun pulling back. I've even let my eye wander and I've debated if I shouldn't just start dating again if we aren't going anywhere but I feel really guilty.
TL;DR:
