TITLE: Kitty messed up their leg - how long should I wait?
POST: My youngest kitten (7 months) was on top of my kitchen cabinets today and slipped and fell off and smacked a counter on the way down. He immediately ran under the bed limping and yowling in pain :(

He started to walk around a bit earlier but has just been sleeping since, and wont let the other cats play with him. I can't really tell if his leg is swollen or not but he definitely seems to be in pain.

My question is, how long should I give him to see if he's going to start walking on it comfortably again? I'd rather not take a trip to the vet just to have them tell me "give it some time", considering that's been the usual answer I've been getting with most of my cat related problems recently.
TL;DR:
