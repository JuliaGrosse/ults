POST: I've been a lurker for some time, but now I want to share my story with you.

This morning, I broke up with my girlfriend of 14 months.
I was so afraid to tell her that I don't love her anymore, but I took all my courage and knocked on her door.
I started to babble about how much I'm sorry for doing this and that I want to end the relationship. Tears were shed and after a few minutes she turns to me and says: 'It's okay.'

She smiled at me and hold my hand to reassure me that everything's gonna be fine.
I wasn't prepared for such a reaction and I just started to ball my eyes out for a good 10 minutes or so. She sat beside me, her hand on my shoulder and telling me that everything's gonna be okay.

She stayed calm and comforted meâ€¦although I was the one breaking her heart. After half an hour, I decided to leave her alone and went home.
I was standing in her door when she smiled at me and said: 'Hey, we can still be friends.'

Back at home I started to get a bad feeling about this and started to rethink my decision.
I'm still sitting here in front of my computer, bewildered at what happened this morning.

I don't know what to think of it...
TL;DR:
