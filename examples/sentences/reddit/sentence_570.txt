TITLE: I[23m] am talking to a [16f] with a 5 month old.  Is it worth the time?
POST: **Bit of clarification: we've been dating for just shy of 6 months.  Not very long, I know...  Also, the age of consent in my state is 16 with no age gap stipulation.**

Its been extremely hard to bring myself to ask others about this because just from the title alone, people will instantly make a judgement.  Obviously she was irresponsible at one point in time and she's quite a bit younger than me, but just hear me out.  Just to put it out there, my parents started dating when my mother was 17 and my father 27.  They've maintained a successful and happy marriage for over a quarter of a century and raised 3 kids.

Several months ago, I hit it off with a waffle house waitress (stick with me).  I thought we were around the same age until she mentioned having a 5 month old child.  She says she was in a relationship with a 19 year old guy who jumped ship when he found out she was pregnant.  They didn't necessarily plan to have children, but after a certain amount of time, they stop using contraception.  They were both stupid to do that but she felt like they were in a stable relationship.  

I have stable work with great pay.  I could easily provide for her and her child, but I'm afraid of being used.  I also don't want to waste time and resources on someone who will just move on when she gets bored or finds something she likes better.  She's still living at home and is still financially supported by her parents for the most part.   She's not a party girl, a drinker or a drug addict. 

I'm only 23, but I've had more than my fill of dating drama and I'm ready to settle down and build a life with someone. 

* Is our age gap going to present challenges that we won't be able to overcome?

* Other than straight up having the conversaion, how can I tell if she's not ready to settle in the same way I am?
TL;DR:
