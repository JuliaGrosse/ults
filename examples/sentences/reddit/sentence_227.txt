TITLE: Me [22M] with my now GF [22F] of a few months: I don't like her friend 22M
POST: While my now GF and I were talking/getting to know each other, she had a friend who she spent some time with and obviously liked her. She denied that he did and continued to hang out with him. Then one night she got drunk at a party and they made out. I then find out that she and him had some history before of trying to make things work and that all of her friends had been trying to set them up.

Now we are dating and she will hang out with him in groups without mentioning that he is coming along or anything. I know this girl really loves me (she loves me better than anyone ever has), and she really does want a future with me. I have mentioned that I don't like her hanging out with him and she says that she talked to him and told him that nothing would ever become between them but I know he still has hope.
TL;DR:
