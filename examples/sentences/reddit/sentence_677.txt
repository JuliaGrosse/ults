SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I've [25 M] had a personal crisis due to online dating.
POST: I'm kind of a shy guy. It really takes me awhile to warm up to meeting new people, friends, potential SO's, etc. and generally they take awhile to warm up to me. This is fine, I'm not super gregarious and it just takes a little while longer for people to get to know me. In college, this didn't really cause any issues with dating, you're around so many people all the time - you get to spend a lot of time with everyone and they get to know you a lot easier. I could easily find common interests and date someone after growing an organic relationship.

However, post-college the only places where I naturally meet people with common interests are my work place, my hobbies and immediate friend circle. None of these are places where I want to insert relationship drama and so I ended up turning to online dating to meet new people. 

So here's the problem: I think my personality type doesn't really fit with the format of online dating at all and I don't really know what to do about it. First off, it's hard for me to have any interest in strangers on the internet. Occasionally I do really gel with people and have great messages back and forth, but when a date happens I just don't feel like I have the ability to relax and be personable in such a short window of time. I'm either kind of aloof/too quiet or if its a really promising date, I feel like I'm under the spot light to make an impression in a short period of time, but this isn't normal for me, so I end up acting out - constantly trying to be funny, I'm super nervous, and other generally undesirable behavior. I've heard feedback that I'm "too challenging", "hard to read", "intimidating", but I just feel like if I had more time I would eventually relax around this new person and they would be more interested.

So what should I do? I yam what I yam and don't want to change, but should I approach it differently?
TL;DR:
