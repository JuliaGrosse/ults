TITLE: Both of my(24f) parents (late 50s) are broke and declining fast. I do not want to help them. Looking for insight from anyone who has experienced something similar.. What will happen? (x-post relationship_advice)
POST: Long story short, my parents screwed up big time in life and now that I am in control of myself financially and otherwise, I do not want them to drag me down (they succeeded in doing this for the first 20 years of my life). 

Both of them have serious medical issues (COPD, Hep C, etc.) and DO NOT take care of themselves at all. They are separated and do not live together. My mom barely makes it paycheck to paycheck and is being hounded by debt collectors. She asks me for money on a monthly basis and I am learning to stand my ground and not help her. My dad is on disability and works randomly but as far as I know does not have any savings to speak of. 

When they get to a point where they can no longer take care of themselves, I do not want to help them. Specifically not financially. I am looking for people with any similar experience, What will happen? What can I expect? I do not want them to end up homeless, but I really need to stand my ground.
TL;DR:
