TITLE: Etiquette for multiple offers and how long I can hold out?
POST: I'll be graduating in May with a degree in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I've got a few years work experience in CS, and ideally would like to do CS work in the aerospace sector. I've had a couple interviews with aero companies that seemed to go really well, but I'm waiting to hear back, and have another with a non-aero company for a CS job. It's a good company, and I would enjoy working there, but what's the etiquette if I'm offered a position there before hearing back from somewhere else? How long can I ride that out? I have several resumes out for other companies that should be pretty promising, too, and I'm not sure I want to give up on them if the CS job gives me an offer, but I also don't want to lose that offer. What's the best way to handle this sort of situation?
TL;DR:
