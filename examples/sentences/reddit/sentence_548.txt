TITLE: Me [20F] with a friend [20F] how do I set boundaries with her wanting to spend time with me?
POST: I feel stupid posting this because this seems so minor compared to other peoples problems but it's making me weirdly stressed out

Okay so I'm a uni student and in November I met a girl on my course called Fran. Fran seemed like a nice person, plus shes a girl and we're on a **very** male dominated course so I initially thought "jackpot" and I put in more effort than I usually do to be friends with her. This has backfired in ways I did not foresee.

I've met tons of people through out my life (as everyone does) and I have never really met someone I found annoying or irritating.

Until Fran.

I feel bad, because she's not necessarily doing anything for me to find her annoying, but god damn, I find myself wanting to tear my hair out after spending any amount of time with her. This feeling 100% intensifies because she's kind of clingy(?) I don't know how to describe it, she's not necessarily needy but she'll follow me like a little baby duck and invite herself along to things. I have a very low tolerance for this, so I was kind of not really thinking her doing this was that weird, but my friend that was reading my conversation with Fran and was really weirded out.

So far I've been dealing with this by lying so I can be alone but next year we're going to be living in the same building (but on completely different floors) and she keeps mentioning that she's going to be coming up to my apartment (I'm living alone) every day. I'm a tiny lil creampuff and have no spine (and no experience with dealing with something like this!) How the hell do I make solid boundaries that get her to back off without being a rude asshole?
TL;DR:
