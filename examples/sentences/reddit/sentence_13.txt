TITLE: How would you deal with this situation if you were in my shoes? (Do you live the life you want, or the life others want you to have? Does love conquer all?)
POST: Dear Reddit,

This is my first post, I'd really value and appreciate your answers! 

I'm female, 20 years old. Born/live in Australia, both parents Lebanese.

I have been dating the most amazingly fantastic creature of all time for just over a year now, though the relationship is doomed because of my parents' hate towards him (despite them never meeting face to face with him before).

Reasons they hate him:

**1.** He's Jewish (My mother says the biggest betrayal I could ever do - EVER - to her is date him [she has never mentioned this anti-Semitism before])

**2.** He's 29 (Nine years older)

**3.**He's different (Mohawk, unique tastes and lifestyle, just... different)

Before he came along, I never knew I could feel this amount of love, care and admiration for someone. He is perfect in my eyes, flaws and all. I'm crazy about him, hanging out with him/kissing him/hugging him never gets old.

If I carry on with the relationship, I will be disowned by entire family. (Father already ignoring me, relationship with my mother already in shambles... I've never had a close relationship to either of them.)

If I end the relationship, I will make my parents happy and will show respect and understanding towards them, but will never know where it could have lead and will lose my best friend, will be forever devastated, (may find someone else just as good????).

I am working and saving up money to move out by the end of the year because I disagree so strongly to how my parents have acted, it's just terrible living in this house.

I am under an incredible amount of stress and rarely sleep well, I go to great lengths to not be in a room with my parents.

Thanks, I hope someone can give me some good advice, I'm really struggling to find people who can help shed light on what's the best thing to do, and so is my boyfriend.
TL;DR:
