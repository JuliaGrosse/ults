TITLE: How do you track shoe prices to get better deals?
POST: I started "seriously" running a few years ago (I'm a slow runner, but by "serious," I mean doing it frequently and entering races). I went to Road Runner and found that the Mizuno Wave Creations were good for my feet. I used to get weird pains before, from an old injury, but they helped me feel much better after a run.

Anyway, I buy a new pair each year, since I put about 300-400 miles on them in 12 months anyway, but each year I was spending like $140 because the new versions had just come out.

Yesterday I hit Road Runner's sale and instead of shelling out $140-160 for the newest model, I just bought a way marked down (and UGLY!) version of last year's for $60 bucks. I'm happy about this, but I was wondering if there was a happy middle, where I can spend maybe $90-100 once a current year's model is a little old but not a whole year old.
TL;DR:
