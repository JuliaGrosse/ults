TITLE: My boyfriend (31/m) is generally kind and fun, but loses his temper and yells at me (32/f) and then feels bad after and apologizes. Should I stay or leave?
POST: We've been a couple for a little over a year and it's been happening more lately. He admits to having a temper, he admits to yelling and me and saying hurtful things. I'm trying to be understanding because he hasn't been in a long-term relationship because so many women have left him and didn't give him a chance at a relationship. He's a successful man and is generally very nice and doesn't like when men are jerks to women, which is why I'm having such a problem with this one. I went to hug him today as we are very affectionate with each other, and he pushed me away and then when I asked him if it's bad to hug him, he lost his cool and started yelling at me and getting angry with me. It's funny because in the past (we live together), he would work from home and had no problem with me going down on him, but if I want to hug him, he freaks out. I don't get it. He tells me he is a jerk and he's sorry for treating me poorly but he keeps doing this and then apologizing and then tells me he'll "work on it" and it just happens again. I am getting to the point where I don't even want to tell him how I feel because he's going to get mad or say that I get sad about little things or that I'm exhausting. He wants to marry me but I'm afraid it won't get better. In all other aspects, he is a nice guy who has been trying to work on his consideration of other people and has become more open-minded during our relationship. Any advice? Can he change? What can I do?
