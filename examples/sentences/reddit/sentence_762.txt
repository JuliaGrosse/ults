TITLE: I (27F) have been a huge narcissistic bitch to my friend (22F) and now I am terrified our friendship is over
POST: Over this past summer I was invited to a wedding. Since I was single I decided to invite my friend as my plus one. She had just graduated and moved back home so honestly I was hoping the wedding would be a time we could just reconnect. She said yes and things looked awesome.
Now here's where bitch Kush comes in :(
She got in trouble at home and as a result couldn't come. Instead of being empathetic I flipped a bitch switch and got angry at her. Obviously this didn't go well and things kind of exploded.
She called me out on how selfish I had been with our friendship, how I hoarded conversations, how I barely knew her because I talk so much about myself. She wasn't wrong. There is a good chance I am a narcissist and this scares the shit out of me because I've heard horror stories of how narcissist can destroy lives. I'm scared that's me :(
I had taken so much time using her as a sounding board that I had neglected her side of our friendship for a long time.
Since then things have been tense. I'm scared because she has every right to end our friendship. A day doesn't go by where I don't feel horrible about this whole ordeal. I really want to make amends and stop being such a narcissistic bitch :(
TL;DR:
