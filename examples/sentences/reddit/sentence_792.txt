SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Boyfriend (21/M) of 1 year was invited to birthday dinner and told me (21/F) to join.
POST: Just last week, a mutual friend of ours invited people through a Facebook message asking them if they could come to her birthday dinner. My boyfriend was part of the Facebook chat, however, I wasn't part of it. He told me it would be fine if I went because I am also friends with the birthday girl, and with the others that are coming. I feel like I wasn't invited though because she didn't add me to the chat. I am scared that she made a reservation and that she will have some trouble getting her table because she has one extra person. My boyfriend told me to not worry about it because she probably assumes that I will be coming with him. Reddit, I'm worrying. Any ideas? Also, her birthday was actually yesterday and I texted her, in hopes she will say something about the dinner. My boyfriend also joked saying "Maybe she will invite you". But she didn't mention anything. Am I thinking too much?
TL;DR:
