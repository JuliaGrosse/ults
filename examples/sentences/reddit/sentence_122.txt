TITLE: My [24M] gf [24F] is visiting an ex [24M] that she considers just a friend
POST: I met this amazing girl a 2 months back and things have never been better. She also has this friend, I'll call Matt, who she used to date a couple years ago in college. She was going through some tough times and became super close with his family, and her and Matt ended up breaking up but still staying close.

Recently she went out of state to visit him for a few days, then see his family for the rest of the trip. The whole trip was set up before we met, and she's mentioned many times about him just being like a brother now. I have no issue with her being friends with him, or even visiting. Matt has roommates and she's sleeping in his room on the floor on an air mattress. She sends me snaps of her helping him with physical therapy and he's shirtless. I just don't want to see that. Again, I 100% trust her, and believe her when she says it's platonic, but it still makes me uncomfortable. How do I talk to her about this and express my feelings without coming off as a jealous boyfriend-type?
TL;DR:
