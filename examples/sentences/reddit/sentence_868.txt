TITLE: TIFU by trying to break up a cat fight
POST: Today I tried to break up a cat fight. It went terribly wrong. Growing up around dogs I learned to break up animal fights by making myself the alpha. Ie. Being loud and making myself larger. 

Anyways cats apparently don't like that much and they ran behind a couch. Me being me of course continues to chase these poor cats and end up ramming my head into a wall making a loud noise and causing both cats to run. One leap far away from me while the other literally flew towards a window, throwing himself at it while pissing himself because he was so scared. The same cat then preceded to attempt his breakout through two different windows. 

Needless to say I learned my lesson and both cats are going to be getting a major petting session when they aren't scared shitless of me.
TL;DR:
