TITLE: Bought and am reading "THE STAND UNCUT" -- was that a wise move or should I have gone with the original?
POST: I just started "The Stand," by Stephen King. Wanting to get the whole deal, I bought the uncut edition.

Reading the novel's introduction, it looks like this edition has about 500 extra pages. THAT IS CRAZINESS. The copy I have right now is 1054 pages. Holy crap, that much more got added -- wow.

**So has anyone read both the uncut and the much shorter original? If so, how do they compare?** I'm reading this now and just beginning to think "this is long -- this is really, really long," and though I'm only 100 pages in a lot of these details don't seem that necessary. The whole introduction to "The Stand Uncut" basically is him saying "this might be an indulgence." Thoughts?
TL;DR:
