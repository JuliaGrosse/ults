TITLE: My roommate and I (both 19f) are both lost; Thinking of finishing up this year and moving
POST: Here's the deal: both my roommate and I have absolutely no idea what to do in life. Not even a clue. We both feel so stuck here, we've grown up in Michigan and can't stand it. We don't want to waste any more money at college without growing a little first and discovering ourselves (typical college kids, right?) and have been thinking of moving out of state, preferably to Cali. I know, I've researched, Cali is EXPENSIVE. However, I feel that given the time to find decent jobs before moving out there and living with her aunt in Fresno while we save up more money and find a good place to live, we would be able to make it work. Whatever happens, whether it ends up being a mistake or not, I think it would be a good life experience to get out of state and, if you will, start over. Please don't comment saying it's a terrible idea, stay in college and finish your degree, etc. etc. All I know is I am miserable here, I feel like I'm not going anywhere in life, and I want a change. Maybe I'll get out and not feel any different, but that's on me. I just need some advice.
TL;DR:
