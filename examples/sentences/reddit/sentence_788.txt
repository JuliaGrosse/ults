SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: [29 M] with [29 F] ex-gf, co-worker, says she no longer has my things -- what to do (or write it off)?
POST: EDIT:  Fairly sure I'm just going to visit her office in peace and ask what happened to my things.  And smile and walk away at whatever the answer is.

Had a relationship for several months with a girl living with her 5-year boyfriend.  

We were very close friends before and were (and still do) work for the same, large company (little chance of running into each other beyond elevators).  After taking a break, I sent her a letter ending things, as the situation became very unstable and intolerable (as she wanted to have both me and the other boyfriend, it seemed).  I received a vitriolic response, and she said she planned to leave some of my things in my office.  

I was working in another office at the time, and assumed my things would be waiting for me when I returned a couple months later.  They were not.  I sent her a text asking for them, no response.  A couple weeks later, I sent another text, she says she does not have them (meaning she either threw them out or destroyed them, or she's lying and keeping them).  It's my favorite sports jersey and a couple of nice watches, probably ~$1k total.  

I have no ill-will towards her, but I think I am owed my belongings or at least an explanation of what she did with them (and perhaps the ~$1k).  But perhaps it's just not worth it....

Do I just write it off?  If not, how do I go about approaching this?
TL;DR:
