TITLE: Me [27 M] with a [25 F] I've been on multiple dates with, couldn't achieve an erection during an essential time
POST: Last night we went on our 4th date - just the simple sit down for a nice dinner and movie afterwards.

We came back to my house and started making out the second we came in the door.  Prior to this, we had only kissed, but this time it led to moving to the bedroom.  We were both super turned on.  I fingered/performed oral on her and made her orgasm.  We then made out for at least 10 minutes before she said it was my turn.

I had this horrible gut feeling and rush of nervousness that I was not going to be able to get hard.  Despite being so turned on and the girl being so beautiful, of course my brain got the best of me. I maintained a semi-erection for a little while (HJ/BJ), but then it just completely went away.

Questions for girls: Would this bother you if this happened to you? (I really just don't want her to feel like it's her fault, because it wasn't.) Would you consider hooking up again or is this a bad sign/deal breaker?

Questions for guys: Has this happened to you? What did you do to solve the issue of being so excited that you made yourself nervous?  Did the girl continue to date you and/or hookup with you even after you were unable to achieve an erection?

Thanks!
