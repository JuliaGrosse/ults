TITLE: TIFU and purchased the wrong channel
POST: Not a throwaway account cause I'm not super embarassed.

 

Obligatory "this didn't happen today" but yesterday my buddy was hyping up this big "Fight of the Century" thing that was supposed to be going down. Like any good friend, I figured I'd front the bill on the channel and he could just pay me back for it later.
 
 

We must have got the wrong channel though! Don't get me wrong, even though my friend got super depressed I thought it was pretty cool watching some guy run a Nascar-styled marathon, going lap for lap in what had to be the smallest track I've ever seen. They even had to put up ropes to keep the guy in the ring as he raced around! Must have not been enough excitement for regulars though, because believe it or not there was also another guy who just kind of kept punching the runner. To his credit the runner just kept blocking and running - I mean occasionally he threw a punch because who wouldn't ya know? - until he had completed so many laps I'd lost count. I did find it silly that they had to have judges at the end to declare him the winner though, I mean, he **was** the only one running the marathon...

 

Anyway! Seems my bud didn't find this as cool as I did, since he just sat there with a look of disappointment and kept shaking his head. I'm thinking next time I will have to be way more careful buying stuff on the TV... I doubt my bud is going to pay me back after such a screwup.
TL;DR:
