SUBREDDIT: r/tifu
TITLE: TIFU by accidentally telling my waitress I was giving her a quarter tip.
POST: So a bunch of my buddies and I went to Atlanta for DragonCon today. We were getting tired and went to a restaurant to eat and chill. The tickets come and mine was about $9.75, so I gave a $10 and the waitress asked if I wanted my change. I knew telling her no meant she would get it, but I didn't know that meant it was the /only/ tip you were going to give. I planned to give her more of a tip. So she comes back, kind of throws my check down in front of me and says, "Sir, I don't need your quarter" real snarky. I immediately feel horrible, realizing she thought that was going to be her only tip from me. So I gave her a $20 tip wrote on the check that I didn't mean it that way.
TL;DR:
