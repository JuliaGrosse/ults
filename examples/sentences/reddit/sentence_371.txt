TITLE: r/relationships... am I[18M] an overly attached boyfriend?
POST: We've been in a long distance relationship for about 5 months now, and it's been amazing. However, the past week or so, when we text she seems uninterested. She used to actively converse with me and it was great, but now she's just throwing one liners at me. She never really contributes to the conversation either. I constantly find myself struggling to come up with a topic to talk about because she just doesn't contribute anymore. It makes me feel like she just doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and it sucks really. Just the other day we were typing to each other on skype, when she told me she was going to do something right quick. She was "gone" for an hour, but was posting on a website we both go to during that time.

Am I overreacting? I just really hate how it makes me feel..

Thanks reddit.
TL;DR:
