TITLE: Need [M/29] advice on how to support a girl [F/30] I fell very hard for
POST: Recently moved back to a city I moved away from 3 years ago, and met this beautiful girl at a softball tournament. Turns out she was just separated and going through a divorce, but that didn't stop us from talking daily and going on outings together. After 2 months she gave me her apartment keys, and we started seeing each other more and more. She just started her CPA program, and is incredibly stressed and busy now. I totally get this, and have to go back to school myself soon. The problem is she is INCREDIBLY independent. After she confessed how hard she was falling for me over the weekend, I get a text yesterday saying she won't be available until the end of December. Obviously I'm hurt...but how do I not ruin anything by asking her about times we can be together or talk. I just feel like I'm walking on eggshells to not stress her anymore. Any advice would help a lot!
TL;DR:
