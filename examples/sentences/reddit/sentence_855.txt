TITLE: Did I accidentally get in the friend zone after a 1 night stand?
POST: I lost my virginity in a 1 night stand to a girl I met at a bar.  I didn't tell her I was a virgin until she put me inside her because I got really nervous when she did that.  Sex was really nerve-wracking at first but I got more comfortable as it went along.  
So the morning after I told her my friends that I was with at the bar were not going to believe that I lost my virginity (I'm 24 which I know is late).  She asked me for my phone number so she could text me pictures of her so my friends would believe me.  Later that day my best friend called her on my phone b/c he still thought I was lying.  Right after that we briefly texted with each other.  
2 or 3 days later she sent me a friend request on facebook.  My reaction was 1. oh that's her last name 2. it will be sorta awkward when she gets a boyfriend but I did lose my virginity to her so I will accept her request.  So I added her and then I see she has all these posts with some bad boy.  I thought ok why would you send someone you had 1 night stand with a friend request after you were already interested in someone else?  So I went to her page to unfollow her in facebook and her latest post was something like "there's nothing better than waking up to Jozea rubbing my bum", seriously who posts stuff like that on facebook.  For the record I wasn't stalking her profile page, like the posts I saw were ones that showed up on my timeline and she would post alot.  
So yeah I am 100% bitter about the situation and I feel like I need to have another 1 night stand to get over this.  If anyone knows the proper 1 night stand day after rules that would be helpful too.
TL;DR:
