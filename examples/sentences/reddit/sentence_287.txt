TITLE: TIFU by doing nothing wrong.
POST: My eBay seller fees for December totaled $12.60. Fine. My PayPal balance was upwards of $50. Surely they'll charge me $12.60 from that, right?

NOPE. Today I get a letter from my bank:

> On 02 JAN 14, [bank name] received and returned an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) item UNPAID. A fee of $25.00 was charged to your [account number] account.

> The EFT item was from PAYPAL for the amount of $12.60. The item was returned for the following reason: Insufficient Funds.

I also get an email from PayPal:

> Hello TortoiseWrath,

> You recently attempted to transfer funds from your bank account. ^^^NO ^^^I ^^^FUCKING ^^^DIDN'T
Your bank has declined the funds transfer because your account did not have sufficient funds available. We will automatically re-attempt this transfer in 3 business days. ^^^OH ^^^GREAT ^^^THANKS ^^^JUST ^^^KEEP ^^^NOT ^^^USING ^^^MY ^^^PAYPAL ^^^BALANCE Please fund your bank account immediately to ensure this transaction can be completed.

I go to my bank. Great, the bank's closed and the ATM is broken. It is the only ATM within 100 miles.

I try to transfer $25 out of my PayPal account to cover both the transaction they're repeatedly trying to make and the -$5 balance they've forced upon my bank account...

> This will take three to four business days.

FUCK YOU. Now you're going to overdraft my account again on Monday, aren't you? Probably in the middle of the night on Monday, before the bank opens so I still won't have any money in it.

Naturally, when I contact PayPal about it, they blame it on me:

> Because you did not ensure your bank account balance was greater than the transaction amount, we cannot assist you in this matter. Please fund your bank account immediately.

So apparently TIFU.
TL;DR:
