TITLE: Did I handle this situation with my friend poorly?
POST: So my friend is 24, and he tends to like the "younger girls". He often jokes about jailbait etc. I don't find this all that alarming, but it does make me a little uncomfortable when he comments on the looks of especially younger girls (14-16 range). So fast forward a bit and he is introduced to my fiance's cousin who is 18. Being a typical 18 year old girl she gets all giddy about him and somehow gets his number. They start texting, and then my friend asks my fiance directly what she would do if he persued a member of her family. Her response, very plainly: "I would murder you." So fast forward a bit more, and my friend is still texting this girl A LOT. She begins contacting me, asking me if he is a good guy. Now is a good point in the story to mention that she lives a good 14 hours away from us, so while the situation is not preferable, it's still nothing I'm concerned about. I basically tell her that as an adult she can make any decision she wants, but she should understand that both me and my fiance don't approve of her getting involved with my friend, and that there would probably be backlash if she did. So me and my fiance at this point are concerned and to be honest, we should have been more vocal to my friend about it. I just honestly didn't think he would do anything to jeapordize our friendship. But I come to find he drove the 14 hour trip just to see her without telling us. And now things are just blowing up faster than any of us could have forseen. Once we found out about this trip we pretty much just stopped talking to both of them completely. Of course this pushed them closer together to the point that now she is MOVING HERE TO LIVE WITH HIM.

Should I have just been happy for him, or am I justified to be pissed that he would do something like this.
TL;DR:
