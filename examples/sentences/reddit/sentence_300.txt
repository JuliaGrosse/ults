SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [25 M] with my Friends [23F] 2 months rebound(being me), stopped talking 4 months ago. She recently broke up with her boyfriend. Should I message her?
POST: Met this girl in June, had a 2 month relationship without being her boyfriend. I really like her. 
We stopped talking because our last date I got drunk, ignored her during the whole night and acted like a drunken fool. 
I guess she saw me as as a different person that night. 
She had recently broken up with her 2 year boyfriend and was meeting new people. We had a connection and I guess she started to see me as a possible new boyfriend.
I messed it all up the night I got drunk. 
Two weeks after we stopped talking she got back with her boyfriend so thats when I realized I was just a rebound.
She broke up with her bf again recently and IÂ´ve been tempted to send her a message about how we could try things again. 
Should I? 
I still have not gotten over her. She is perfect.
What should I message her about? How can I approach her again?
Thanks for the help.
TL;DR:
