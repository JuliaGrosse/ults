TITLE: Has a new location encouraged you to change your habits?
POST: I've lived in the same city in LA for nearly 21 years (my whole life), and I'm seriously ready to gtfo. I have Colorado in mind; I've never been (I'm planning to soon), but I just feel like my heart will feel at home there. I've always been drawn to nature, serenity, and outdoor activities.

The problem is, I'm a shy home-body, almost a hermit. It's how I've grown up to be, and I want to change that. I've been living practically in the same spot my entire life, so I don't feel excited to try new things, get out and explore, or meet new people (it's incredibly hard where I live..everyone is out for themselves here). I don't feel encouraged by the city's energy and go-go-go mentality. I just feel trapped, and I hate the vibes here! I want to feel free and get away from the pollution, both physical and mental. I feel that if I move (and I might be idealizing this) I'll be forced outside of my comfort zone and thrown into a new place where I have every opportunity to explore and try new things. I know that change is internal and I have to make changes now and not rely/wait on moving to a new location.
TL;DR:
