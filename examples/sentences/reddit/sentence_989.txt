TITLE: TIFU by ignoring a car full of black boys hollering at me
POST: I'm a fairly nice looking, skinny, blonde girl.  I get yelled at/honked at by men in cars all the time (I got to college, so I must walk everywhere) and it **drives me crazy**.  I always ignore it because I have a boyfriend, you hollering at me from a car does not interest me, **nor is it classy or attractive**.  

So I'm late for an appointment, hurrying to get to my friend's car.  I cross a rode behind my house, where a black kid sticks his head out of the car and says something like "Hey sugar."  I ignore it and keep walking.

Before I know it, they have rolled down all the windows of the car and all of them are yelling, "Blondie! Blondie! Hey girl! Blondie!" etc. But not yelling anything specific.  I was already in a bad mood from running late, so I keep ignoring them and start walking faster.  

Then I realize I dropped my sweatshirt (it was draped across my purse).  I turn around and don't see it, but see some people across the street pointing and saying, "They grabbed it for you!"  So I scurry back to the end of the block, and the car is nowhere to be seen.  Not only today did I realize I'm racist and a bitch, but then they stole my nice sweatshirt.
TL;DR:
