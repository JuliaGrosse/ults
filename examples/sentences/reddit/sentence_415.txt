TITLE: For anyone that likes jiffy pop, have you noticed a horrendous decline in the quality lately? Or am I unlucky?
POST: I usually buy jiffy pop alot, eat it once a week with a movie with my love. A few months ago I got 2 pack, opened it and started making it. It EXPLODED hot butter all over the stove and the side of it came out, like the aluminum wasn't put in right. I was like ok, it happens. Second one did the same thing. I called them and told them hey, some kid is gonna get hurt. Watch your quality. Send me some coupons for free popcorn. Awesome. Last week I got another batch, after months of not having it, waiting maybe for stick to clear. Different batch number and all. This time the wire holding it popped out and butter spewed everywhere. Second one started up and a hole ripped in it and stuff came out. Damn, is it my luck or are they making it shitty now?
TL;DR:
