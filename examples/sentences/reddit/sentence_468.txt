TITLE: What do you do when you get blown off?
POST: Back story:  4 years ago I was in a relationship that really screwed with me and I left it pretty messed up in the head.  A year and a half later I got over the relationship and then started medic school which for those of you that don't know is a year + of your life.  Finished school and continued being single simply because I was lost as to what to do.
Fast forward to 2 weeks ago:  Met a very nice and pretty girl who's a friend of a friend, we hit it off things looked swell (that word doesn't get enough play these days).  We got coffee a couple times and hung out with friends.  Last week we hung out at my place watching a movie and just talking until 2 am.  I asked her out, she said probably, the condition being that might go out with her cousin that day.  We agreed yesterday to go out today (nothing fancy she doesn't like that and is a very picky eater).  She said she would text me after work, nothing.  Called 2 hours later but I got nothing, text an hour and a half after that to no reply as well.  This is the first girl I've really shown interest in/gotten a positive reply back in 4 years.  WTF do I do?
TL;DR:
