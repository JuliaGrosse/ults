SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me a [18m] first year university sudent fell for another [18f] 2 months everything has been going well except she moved away, to study a different degree.
POST: Like the title says we went to uni together, we stayed at the same college. We got to know each other quite well. We became very good friends and the relationship started escalliting quite quickly.  We had a few fights while we were together at college, nothing to big. 

We were both looking to study dentistry in the future, little did we know we both received different late offers from different universities. 

I decided I wanted to stay in my current course to experience it and confirm what I want to do in the future and expeience college life as I would be moving back with my parents. 

She decided to take it, and moved of out. She is enjoying her course, we talk daily via Skype to try keep the relationship going. We've made plans to travel to one another when it's convenient for both of us so we can meet. I want to try make it into the same uni she is in just so we can be together. 

I would say I am fairly good looking as I have been chased after quite often by the other gender. I have had quite a few flings through out my life and early days of uni. 

I have been out to the club's and tried picking up girls to get my mind off her. I have been successful but I don't feel satisfied so before we got anywhere serious I kicked her out. I'm not sure if this is because of how much I liked this pervious girl and I miss her, or its my regret of not doing what I truly want. 

I like to think it is the first, I told her about it. She has been the first and last thing on my mind since the first day I met her. Talking over Skype she keeps dropping hints that she wants a long distance relationship. I want this to work out for us, even if it means me moving half way across the country to be with her.
TL;DR:
