TITLE: Second First Date
POST: Some context before I start:

I (M, 17) am going on a first date with someone (F, 16) from another school (we met on tinder, had a mutual friend vouch for me). My last relationship lasted about 6 months, but is the only relationship I have ever been in, and we were friends for a year before we started dating. 

Essentially, this is really my first actual "first date" scenario, and while I'm not terribly nervous or self-conscience, I understand that I'm terribly inexperienced at this sort of thing. I don't plan on doing anything more than kissing her good night, (we're just having dinner tonight at a good restaurant that we both love with waiters I know) I would absolutely LOVE to hear some tips that you guys have picked up through your years of going into a first date without ever having met the person you're going out with.
TL;DR:
