TITLE: Coworker won't talk to me after I called in sick
POST: Title gives the gist, here's the devil in the details. I work at a sort of vocational school. If you are sick, you're supposed to call it in. That's because they need to find a substitute instructor or just postpone the class. Well, one morning I woke up, felt like crap, and called the office. The person I talked to actually wasn't in admin but is one of my colleagues. Why she was answering the phones, I don't know. As she was asking me questions about not coming in to work (feel like I'm gonna puke, don't think its a good idea for me to speak in front of office executives) when suddenly--I puke. On the phone. So she quickly relayed my condition to the staff, they need to get a sub trainer pronto.

I have laryngitis and some kind of flu. As soon as I can start talking and I don't feel like my insides are on fire, I email the office to let them know I am coming to work that day.
This coworker sits in the cubicle next to me. I apologize to her and tell her how embarrassed I was she had to deal with all on the phone. But she doesn't even look at me or acknowledge I am there.
Normally, I'd say 'eff it' and get back to work. However, she is a nice person and we often chat because we sit together. We are work colleagues and professional but also have a civil relationship. No romance, we like to keep the chit chat to work stuff-great. But that is out the window apparently. 

Help me, reddit! What can I do or say to at least get things back on track and we can make dumb jokes at our other coworkers expense?
