TITLE: Me [15 M] with my friend [15 F] of 5 months, may be interested in me.
POST: So, there's this girl I met on Instagram and have on and off alked to her for a few months. I am going to soon meet her in person and want to scope her out for some signs that she may like me. Note, we haven't met in person-EVER. But she knows a little about me and what I look like. But a friend was saying she might be nervous about talking to me because she may like me, or just cuz I'm a boy. She is the shy type, after all. Personally I'm banking on the latter. :/

So, this reaches out to teen (or once teen) girls. What are the REAL signs that you are interested in a boy? Or is this just all about the girl herself? I always hear things about her looking at you and looking away when the guy sees them. Ya know, typical things.
TL;DR:
