TITLE: My [f/28] gf has suddenly become distant right before I [m/26] went on a family trip
POST: We've been dating for one month and up until last week, she was very warm towards me. However, the day before I left to help my whole family move into a new city (two days drive each way), she became cold towards me.

While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all. My mom thinks it's because I missed an opportunity to meet her family (she mentioned that she wanted me to meet her family on a public holiday that passed while I was away a few weeks ago), is afraid I might leave, or I said something to hurt her. 

Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative.

That said, when I returned home, all of her toiletaries were gone from my bathroom. She had been looking after my cat for me while I was away, and it's a bit of a shock for me.
TL;DR:
