TITLE: Help Challenging a grade based on stupid human error.
POST: I just looked up my grades for my previous quarter in school and realized I failed a course.  I was certain I was going to pass it and I start to look at what is wrong, and then I find I have a missing grade where my final assignment (worth a lot of points) should be.  After a little more poking about I find the following e-mail:
"Sorry I wasn't in class this morning, my roomate hadn't realised I was back from the weekend and turned off my alarm.
Attached is my final music theory assignment.  Please let me know if you want a printed copy (on any media, within reason, of your choosing) and when you'd like it.  If just this attachement is enough, also let me know.
Sorry about this mixup, see you in class Wednesday."
Sadly, I found this message still sitting in my drafts box.  I figured it was because that day (just after finishing the e-mail) the fire alarm in my dorm building went off and I didn't hit send.
My question is this: do you think I have any hope of challenging this grade based on this incident?  If so, how would I go about it (contact professor, or department head, or dean)? If not, why do you think not.

Thanks for reading.
TL;DR:
