TITLE: [21M] Through Tinder, I'm entering a situation of dating multiple girls...help! What do I do?
POST: Never been in this kind of situation before, I need advice.

I chatted with one girl on Tinder awhile ago, we hit it off, I got her number and we met up for coffee. We chatted for hours and kissed at the end and decided to meet up again. I definitely get along with her really well and am very attracted to her.

However, there's another girl, pretty much a dream girl for me, that I've been chatting with on Tinder for awhile now. We chatted on Tinder for hours and hours last night, I think from about 11 PM to 4 AM. We have an absolutely ridiculous amount of stuff in common and she seems to really like me even just over text. We got to know each other on a very personal level too with a game of 20 Questions. She wants to meet up to watch a movie and cuddle later, and I really want to be with her.

So...what do I do here? I like the first girl, but I really, really want to be with the second girl. However, I don't want to ruin my chances with the first girl...man, I wish I could just be with both! They're both so great!
TL;DR:
