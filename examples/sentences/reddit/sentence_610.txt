TITLE: TIFU by getting the mail
POST: I should start out by first mentioning that I'm living in an apartment complex and have never gotten packages delivered here before so I don't know how the whole system works for packages.

So I was expecting two packages to be delivered, one box with shoes and another box with a phone case for my new phone. I get a text message saying one of my packages were delivered, cool yay!
So I open the door and don't see anything on the porch so i go to our mailbox which isn't really large enough for the boxes and get the mail. 

When I'm getting the mail I see two sets of keys and both have tags saying that they keys are property of post office and if found return by dropping into a mailbox. So my first thought is 
"Oh, the mailman must have accidentally left these in my box and is probably looking for them! Better drop it into the mailbox slot below" (there's an outgoing mailbox below my box).

But before I do that, my curiosity gets the best of me and I try sticking the keys into these larger boxes below mine and the key fits! I don't turn it though because I don't want to be caught tampering with other people's mail and I sated my curiosity for where the keys went already. I mindlessly drop both keys into the outgoing mail box slot and then 2 seconds later it hits me...
those keys were for me to open those larger *PACKAGE SIZED* boxes so I could retrieve my packages...
TL;DR:
