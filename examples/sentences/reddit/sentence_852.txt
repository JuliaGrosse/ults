SUBREDDIT: r/cats
TITLE: Please, if anyone has any advice I have a very sick cat and Vet visits aren't helping.
POST: So over the last year we struggled with urinary issues with my male cat Scooter (we had him and a younger female named Lyra). We allowed my friend's cat to stay with us for a week because she was moving but after that he got a really bad UYI and we began a battle with urine issues until the beginning of January this year when he began blocking and was at the vet for about 2 solid weeks before we had to make the decision to put him to rest, he was in so much pain. Lyra was miserable so after 2 months we finally caved and got a kitten: Meseeks. The night we brought Meseeks home Lyra was super tense so we gave her some of her wet food (usually a treat once or twice a week) which she gobbled down. That night she puked 3 times, and once more Thursday morning. That is the last time she has eaten. She was dry heaving while we were gone Thursday (spit and bile). She's now been to the vet twice, and they said she has an inflamed stomach lining. She won't take the medicine they prescribed the first time and my instructions after the second visit were to try to help her destress. She's still spitting up in her mouth and making the puking meow. She shows interest in the new kitten, tense but not a lot of hostility. I'm not sure how else to help her, and I'm very worried because I haven't seen her drink anything.
TL;DR:
