SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My (27F) boyfriend (33) of 1 year never compliments me.... ever.
POST: I've been seeing my SO for about a year now and I'm absolutely over the moon for him. I don't know how I got so lucky. The only problem is, he never compliments me on anything, ever. Whether I'm dressed to the nines or completely naked, he never says anything one way or the other about my appearance. In the last 12 months I can scrounge up 3 distinct compliments ("you're pretty cute", "you don't complain when we hike", and "you're cute") and the first one was basically coerced out of him.

I know that the usual answer to relationship problems is "talk to them about it", but in this situation I feel that that would be tantamount to *telling* him to compliment me, which defeats the whole point. I know he loves me, we spend a lot of time just cuddling up together, but this really makes me feel that somehow he's not actually physically attracted to me, and that really hurts. How can I bring this up without seeming like I'm fishing for compliments? I mean, I guess I am, but doesn't everyone want to feel attractive sometimes?
TL;DR:
