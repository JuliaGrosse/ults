TITLE: Gf [24] cheated on me [21] and lied to me. We live together and I need help really bad.
POST: So we have been together for about a year now. I found out the other day that she had went out to the bar with another guy about a month ago on 4 separate occasions. On one of them she went to his house and they made out. She never told me she went out with him I had to find out from a mutual friend.

When I asked her about it she lied to my face over and over even when I told her that our friend told me. I told her we are through and she went nuts and just keeps badgering me to give her another chance. I still don't know if she slept with him or not and if she did she would never tell me. I would be gone by now but we both have nowhere to go and our lease isn't up til October.

Part of me still loves her and wants to take her back because I was happy with her. Then I think about those nights she betrayed me. I don't know what to do at this point. Every time we talk it's just her saying I love you, crying, apologizing and me just laying into her about what she did. I'm having a dilemma here and I need help bad. Just someone give me advice I'm desperate.
TL;DR:
