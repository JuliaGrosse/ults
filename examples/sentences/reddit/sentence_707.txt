TITLE: TIFU by getting too drunk and scream vomiting.
POST: So this was last night. I went to a friends party and proceeded to make a sorry attempt to drink away my life problems by drinking more booze than a human being should. Now I am the type of person who is very afraid of bothering people, so when I inevitably started to feel sick, I decided the best place to vomit would be behind my friends shed outside, so I laid down in the cold, wet grass and vomited on myself and the grass. I thought no one would notice I was feeling sick and therefore wouldn't be a bother to anyone, which was idiotic. I'm guessing one of my other friends realized that I was missing and went looking for me and found me laying in my own vomit behind a shed shivering and soaked. He went and got my other friends, who saw me shivering, crying, laying in vomit, and pretty much in the most pathetic state imaginable.They coaxed me into standing and tried helping me back to the house, but I got sick on the way and collapsed in his backyard. Take two, this time I got to the bathroom, and began scream vomiting (aka [liquid scream] I was forced into my sober friends car and driven home where I stumbled to my room and passed out. I was the only person to get this drunk at the get together, and now think that all my friends are judging the fuck out of me. Oh, and now I have a cold.
TL;DR:
