TITLE: I [M 23] think I'm falling for someone [F 23] I shouldn't.
POST: About early January I began dating this girl and i never really thought it was going to go anywhere. But i think I'm falling for her. She's one of the most amazing girls i have ever met in my entire life. She's beautiful, smart, happy, and she makes me feel....i guess. Happy. It's not like a "I need you in my life happy" but more of a "You make me better in so many ways happy, when you smile, my smiles bigger."

I've only been seeing this girl for about 2 months. But here's the kicker. She used to be a really good friend of mines ex-gf. Well not really a CLOSE friend. But just a good friend that i know and used to hang out with. 

Thing is, i don't know if i should break it off with her. I don't want to. But it seems like shes losing friends because of it, and i don't want anything bad to happen to her. Especially if it's because of me. 

She tells me she doesn't care. But I'm sure she does. I just want to see her happy, she deserves it. 

What should i do guys? I really don't want to not see her anymore. But i don't want her to lose her friends because of me.
TL;DR:
