TITLE: I (21F) found a friend's (21F) boyfriend (24M) on Tinder.. And she's on Erasmus.
POST: Like the title says.. I have a friend who is dating a guy for almost a year now. For the past 6 months she's been on erasmus and we haven't spoken much during that time. From her Facebook it seems like maybe things aren't completely ok between the two of them, but I can't be sure. 

Last week I created a tinder account and today I found him there! First I was confused, because tinder isn't exactly the place where you go just to make friends, and I thought that maybe it's an old account and he doesn't use it anymore. So I added him and we were a match, which was proof that he was active on Tinder at least for the past week. 

Now I don't know what I should do. I don't think ignoring the situation is an option. I could: 1) tell her right away that I found her boyfriend on Tinder,  2) talk to him and figure if he's there just for the fun of it, if he's interested in sex, finding someone, and then tell her, 3) any other brilliant option you can give me. 

I know this isn't the most important topic but there are reasons as to why I'm not telling her right away. First because I haven't spoken to her that much during these 6 months and it would be weird to talk to her now just to tell her this when it might not mean anything. And second, I'm in love with a guy who has a huge crush on her (and yes, I know this is really selfish!) but I would hate to see him running straight to her to mend her broken heart. But talk with him to see his intentions can be a bad idea, because maybe she'll get mad at me for doing that. 

So reddit, what should I do?
