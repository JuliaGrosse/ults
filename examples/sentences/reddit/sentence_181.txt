TITLE: Mixed gas & oil in the lawnmower... HELP!
POST: Okay Reddit, here's the story.  Dad gets a new lawnmower, I see only one tube to put gas into.  I pour it down that gas tube, but I notice that it's smaller than our last lawnmower.  I poured a LOT into it...

Without thinking too much, I go out and hold down the lever and pull the cord.  The engine starts for 2 seconds and starts and then dies down and kills itself.  I realize that there's another tank separately for gas and oil (was not aware of this...).  I read Google and people tell me to pour the entire mixture out of the oil tank.

I did so and all of it was poured out.  I leave the valve open and let it dry for 36 hours.  I come back and pour in a new oil.  I slowly pulled the cord to "let some oil into the engine to hopefully clean out the bad mixture that might have gotten in."  Then I pour out that old mixture and pour in new oil again for "clean" oil.  I go and try to start the lawnmower and it isn't starting properly.

I know what I did was wrong and I don't need people reminding me that I made a mistake, my only question is... what do I do at this point?  Is the motor for the lawnmower totally shot?  What does Reddit think?
TL;DR:
