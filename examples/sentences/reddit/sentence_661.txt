SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [26M] got fucked and chucked by her [24F] on our second date. Feeling pretty lousy.
POST: I met her on OkCupid last weekend. We went out for coffee and had a really nice conversation for about two hours. We texted a lot over the next few days and things seemed to be going pretty well.
  
We had our second date last night. We went out for dinner and  drinks and the conversation was flowing pretty smoothly. I suggested that we move on to another bar. She suggested we go back to her place and drink.
  
We ended up making out on her couch and things moved to the bedroom and we had sex. Not long after we were done, she asked me to leave. She had work in the morning and I didn't, so I didn't think much of it because she needed to sleep.
  
This afternoon I got the text saying she wasn't interested in pursuing things any further. Did I do something wrong? She seemed to enjoy the sex very much, so I don't think it was that. I feel so used and could use some kind words.
TL;DR:
