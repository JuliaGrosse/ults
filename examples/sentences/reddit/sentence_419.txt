TITLE: TIFU by saving a little girl from harm
POST: This happened a few months ago but regardless.... I was on a field trip with some business classes when we went to the mall to eat in the food court. It was the middle of the day and of course the mall was packed with people. I left my friends at the table while they ate so I could get a hot pretzel. Halfway there, I see a little girl about 3 or so try to spin a type of game spinning wheel. Here's where everything went wrong. It was a tripod type wheel, on a table, and it was at least twice her size. She hit it and it fell towards her. I sprinted over and used myself to block her as I tried to catch it. Needless to say, it fell on the flow with a loud bang and I asked the girl if she was okay as her mother came over from across the way. I fix the wheel before the saleslady came over to do so. That's when I notice that the whole food court stopped and stared. I made eye contact with my teacher and she laughed so loud. She was the only one who saw what happened in full. Everyone else, including my friends, thought I had walked into the table, knocked stuff over and caused a huge commotion.
