TITLE: I [32 M] with [27/F] looking for advice on making a long distance relationship work
POST: Hey guys, I've been dating this girl for 6 months now and we live 4 hours apart via car, 1 hour via plane. So far the distance doesn't seem to be causing any issues. We have great daily communication and try not to go more than 3-4 weeks without seeing one another. We both have busy schedules so its not always easy to coordinate a weekend to hang out but it seems to be working so far. We try to have the next 3 on going months planned out so we know exactly when will see one another. We always do something fun when we hang out, maximize our weekends together and growing closer and closer with each weekend. I've known her for over 7 years now but recently started taking things more serious and I would love to make this work. I was curious to know if anyone out there has some advice on making long distance work or someone who has had success with it in the past? I know some people have a much longer distance to deal with and 4 hours isn't bad at all but there still lingers a gap of not seeing one another regularly that can make it difficult. Any tips or recommendations on what you did that worked and what I should try to stay away from? Thanks in advance for your knowledge and experience.
TL;DR:
