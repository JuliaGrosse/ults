TITLE: I [22F] lost a power play to my hopefully ex boyfriend [25M] when I tried to break it off.
POST: Hi everyone. I need advice on how to proceed in my situation and how to do it in a way that will be clear, effective, and will not hurt him. 

I have been dating this man since he was 16 and I was 14 (nearly 9 years). Some major life events happened where I needed a lot of emotional support that I didn't get from him and for the past 3 years or so, I've been unhappy with our relationship but very reluctant to let go of my best friend. 

I decided that I need to be an individual and branch out, not to mention that I'm going to grad school soon. So I broke up with him this weekend and I stayed with my family so he could figure out new living arrangements and the like. He said that he wanted to discuss the break up and I've been working on being more adult about my feelings so I agreed. During the discussion, he said that he did not want to give up without a fight and suggested counseling and spending more time together. I didn't have much choice it felt like but to agree. 

Now I'm in the situation from hell where he won't stop following me around and being extremely present and got upset when I slept in the living room last night. It's way worse than it was and I can't take it anymore. 

Now I just want to finalize the break up and move on but I don't know how to do it in a way that he won't be extra hurt.
TL;DR:
