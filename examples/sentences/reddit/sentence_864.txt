TITLE: Me [34M] with my girlfriend [31F] of 2 months. She's pregnant and wants us to keep the baby.
POST: Met my girlfriend on OKCupid in February and had our first date on 25th February. Things then moved really fast and with me staying at her place 5 night out of 7 most weeks. 

We became so comfortable so quickly, that she gave me a key before 6 weeks had passed, though she later admitted she mistakingly thought we had been dating much longer.

Yesterday she was very quiet and appeared to be visibly worried and holding something in. After a little questioning she finally admitted she was pregnant.

Neither of us are religious, and I don't believe that life begins at conception, so my first instinct was that we should probably abort this unplanned pregnancy; however, it is her body and I felt the choice was predominantly hers to make, so told her I would fully support what ever decision she made. 

She has decided she wants to keep the baby and I'm trying to act really supportive and reassure her that everything will be okay, but inside I'm petrified and suddenly feel very trapped.

She went to the doctor today who confirmed she's around 4 weeks, and scheduled a 12 week scan. She doesn't want us to tell anyone until 12 weeks as due to an existing medical condition there is a slightly higher than normal chance of miscarriage; however, I could really do with some advice/reassurance so I'm turning to you guys instead. 

I really don't feel ready for any of this and also really worried this situation will make me resent my girlfriend and ruin our relationship. At the same time I was raised by a single mother and always vowed to never be an absentee father. I'm so confused right now, but trying to act calm for her and be reassuring, but can tell she's worried about me and the situation we found ourselves in.

Help!
