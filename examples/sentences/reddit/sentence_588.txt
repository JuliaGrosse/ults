TITLE: My [17f] parents [ 46m & 43f] bought my mom's sister's [52f] house for her asking price. After seeing the renovations we had done my aunt and niece [23f] are making it out to everyone like they got ripped off. Should I tell my parents what they are saying? What do I say when people ask me about it?
POST: My parents always tell me not to ignore gossip but my dads business relies on his reputation for being trustworthy. I'm worried what them running their mouths to everyone who will listen might do to him. 

My aunt in particular is acting like she's being the bigger person by not kicking up a fuss. She says stuff like "It's a shame even family doesn't treat you right these days but Jesus said to turn the other cheek. Guess all we can do is pray on 'em." 

It's not their fault she didn't think of or couldn't afford renovating! The house didn't have whatever value she thinks she lost UNTIL they put it in!
TL;DR:
