TITLE: Need a kick in the butt to get out of this winter rut.
POST: Longer post, lots of background. Bear with me. Also, if you've got a better place for me to post this, let me know!

I graduated college May 2012, and I've been dicking around in the service industry because it's the only thing that can pay my student loan bills. I recently moved (from Milwaukee, WI to Door County, WI) and worked a job this past summer that was semi-relevant to what I went to school for, but it didn't work it out. It bummed me out awhile that I couldn't even hold a basic office job, but I knew it wasn't a good fit at all.

I dig serving/bartending because I like interacting with people, among a slew of other reasons but it's our slow season. Where I live, there aren't a lot of young people this time of year. It's a super seasonal, touristy region that kills it in summer, but winters (especially my first winter away from a city) are rough socially, mentally and financially.

In any case, I'm bored. With myself, with my life. I feel all my interests that thrive just dying out. Partially because of Wisconsin weather and my inconvenient geographic location for social interaction, but mostly because I feel my passion for learning and bettering myself slipping away by the minute. I live with my boyfriend who's able to entertain himself quite well, but I find myself getting into the Netflix/Reddit/books rut. I can't quite afford going back to school for certificate classes that'd force focus on something I'm interested in. I just feel useless. A bored little lump on the couch.

I read enough, but I can't get myself to act upon anything. I go to he gym. I play around on apps like Duolingo and Codeacademy, but the whole lure of those are how you can do small amounts at a time. Nothing can keep my attention long enough to get me truly excited. I just feel like I'm going through the motions.
TL;DR:
