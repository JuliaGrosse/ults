TITLE: Rabies: Am I infected?
POST: 31, male, no current health problems.

I have been camping in Greece, and was followed by some abandoned puppies. I had some really light scratches on my hand from breaking sticks for a fire. The following morning these three pups came and climbed all over me and as I pushed them off they were licking my hand. 

One hour later, as I am packing to leave, I poured some water for them, and realised that one of these pups could not drink well, and it foamed at the mouth. 

I washed and within another hour I had used medical alcohol on my hand. 

It was three and a half days ago. I spent yesterday in vain navigating Athens, and today I went to the hospital. The doctor seemed to not comprehend the severity of a man without symptoms. He did pointless tests such as blood pressure and with a stethoscope. 

"You have no symptoms" he said. I was refused the vaccine. He tried to reassure me that I could go to the ER if I felt photophobia or other symptoms. I hate to be that guy who second-guesses the doc, but the vaccine only works before symptoms occur, after which it is an incurable fatal condition (amirite?).
TL;DR:
