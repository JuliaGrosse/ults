TITLE: Is anybody else sickened at the current state of our education system?
POST: Upon coming to my state university about 3 years ago, I realized just how far behind my school district was compared to a majority of other students coming from different districts.  Where they had graduated > 90% of their original class (with an average GPA of about 3.0+), my graduating class was about 1/3 of the size it was intended to be (we started with 330ish, graduated about 135).  Every other district was about 2 years ahead in the curriculum compared to my high school.  My school district was in a highly urban area, where a fair portion of the student body survives on the "free lunch" system.  Our educational system (at least in Iowa) is currently experiencing wide spread budget cuts.  More and more I feel like, even my own siblings, are at a disadvantage when entering college because of the decline in the quality of education.  This isn't even considering the vast majority of people I know that will never make it to college simply because the system has told them "it is not for them," and they repeat that sentiment.  I feel like I'm ranting, but I honestly feel like, unless you come from a "rich" high school today, you can be so far behind your peers upon entering college, that trying to compete with them academically becomes an even greater challenge.
TL;DR:
