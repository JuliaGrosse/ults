TITLE: Reddit! My appartment has mold and our landlord wont do anything about it. What can we do?
POST: So we have lived in our apartment for several years. We have dealt with the mold since the first winter we moved in (moved in in august and there wasn't a problem). We do everything we can to keep up with it, dri-z-air containers in every room, ionic pro air cleaner, run a fan all night long in the bedroom (burrrr) and I can only clean so much! The windows are old and we have asked the landlord to replace them and they refuse saying that "it hasn't helped other renters in their units with mold". They came in to "check" the mold, rather they had their maintenance man come in and look at the window sills ask us to clean it then told us he would come back in two weeks to check how quickly it was growing. They did this in June....the dry season...I have taken pictures of the worst of it and sent them to the property management company and had several conversations with the landlord about it. I have taken to every spring doing a cleaning then putting on a fresh coat of Killz but it comes back every year. The mold is under our bed and on the wall that the bed is aginst, behind the desk, in every window and window sill and the sliding glass door, the wood around the largest window in the living room is soft and the paint bubbles during the winter. Im sure we will have to throw out a large portion of our furniture (the one that pisses me off the most is a dresser and desk I have had since I was a child that I love) Moving isn't an option, its nearly impossible to find a place in our town that takes dogs and isn't over run with screaming children. I'm sure this is affecting our health and the health of our dogs but its apartment the landlords aren't going to do anything about it. So, Reddit what can I do?
