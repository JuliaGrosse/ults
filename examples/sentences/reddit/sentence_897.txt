TITLE: Boyfriend's [24m] friend [24f] is getting married - I [23f] am not invited. How do I handle this without overreacting?
POST: I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years and we have been living together for the past 3 years. We live a couple of hours away from our hometown, as we both moved to the city for job opportunities/university. 

At the start of the year my boyfriend's good friend, let's call her Emily, got engaged. We were so happy for her and both attended her engagement party (with a present I picked out). While I am not especially close with Emily I have met her many times, I was at her 21st, have been to her and her fiance's house and we have always gotten along well. 

Yesterday my bf received a call from Emily and she told him that I would not be invited to the wedding, as the guest list was getting too large and expensive, as well as the fact she doesn't see me often. While I understand that weddings are expensive and guest lists must be a huge pain, I also feel incredibly insulted that she has decided to cut me out. 

I know that other plus ones have definitely been invited, and while I know that I don't see Emily very often the reason for that is my bf doesn't see her very often, as we live 2 hours away.  

My bf is very non-confrontational, and while he is also upset that I cannot go I do not believe he would even think to not attend the wedding, even though he will know very few people there. But I feel like after 5 years, our relationship warrants a plus one to a wedding, and to not invite me is insulting and dismissive of our very serious relationship. 

I am really hurt by this, as I thought we were also friends by association, or at least friendly. Is it an overreaction/too controlling to ask him to consider not attending? How do I manage the hurt feelings?
TL;DR:
