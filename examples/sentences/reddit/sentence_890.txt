TITLE: How can I make small talk more natural?
POST: Hello, I (20m) am looking for some tips involving socialization. I've been one that keeps to themselves often, and, I feel horrible saying this, find small talk to be a drag. I can talk all day about things that interest me, or to a long time friend of mine. When it comes to being in class, or some public event, I often find myself sitting quietly, or staying with the people I already know. When I eventually do talk to people, I often feel like I'm putting up a fa√ßade just to "make it through" this conversation. I do have a retail job at a grocery store, so talking with customers when I have the time has helped me smooth out some bumps. However, if I'm not forced to interact, I often choose not to. What can I do to make small talk feel more meaningful? What are some tips you have so I can project that I care about what the other person is talking about? Because I often feel that I may sound like I care, I don't believe my body language is that way.
TL;DR:
