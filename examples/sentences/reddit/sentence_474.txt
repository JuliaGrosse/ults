SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: Just got hired to teach social studies. They asked me to create/teach an elective of MY CHOICE.  What elective does reddit think I should teach?
POST: I'm a social studies teacher with a background in acting, making films, obsession with hidden history/conspiracies, photography, current events, etc.

My school asked me to create a FUN and EXCITING elective class to teach 9-10th graders for one period a day.
So far I'm thinking about...

Living History - a class focused on historical simulations, reenactments, role playing, hands on activities (butter churning, etc best example off top of my head)

History Through Film - Analyze historical Hollywood films and other films; determining what is accurate and what is not. Students can also create their own short films which they believe are more accurate in terms of the facts.

Historiography (study of what, who, why of history) & Hidden History - Examine multiple sources (text books with different views) to determine what really happened, what's been omitted, etc.

History of film.

History of NYS.

I'd like to weave in some sort of lesson about Tesla! And all that other stuff we should have learned about in HS. I want my students to crave more and more. I want them to QUESTION EVERYTHING. Anyway I appreciate any feedback I can get.
Right now I'm overwhelmed but excited. Let's hear those ideas! Thanks.
TL;DR:
