TITLE: When my girlfriend gets drunk she likes to kiss other girls and I don't like it. M[22] dating F[21] for 10 months
POST: When my girlfriend [21] goes out to drink with her lady friends, she likes to make out with them saying it is just fun and there are no feelings. I believe her in that there is no feelings but I still don't like that she does it. I have brought it up a few times and she just says she likes to but it is nothing and I shouldn't worry. I does only happen once every couple months and I know she loves me and I love her but I don't like when she does it. Am I in the wrong letting it get to me or should I just let it happen?
TL;DR:
