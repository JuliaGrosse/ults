TITLE: My friend[F48] i no longer comfortable with hosting me[F32] and my BF[M28] when we are in town because my BF will be in the apartment without me.
POST: Ok I have known my friend for 10 years and we are very close.I bring my BF(of 4 years) and child(M2) to town and we plan to spend the weekend. She offers we can spend the night. Great. We are both supposed to go to a party friday with a mutual friend. My BF wants to hang out with his own friends and not go to the party. Next day he will probably be hang over and needs to rest. 

She then asks, "let me get this straight? Is he gonna be in the apartment without you?" She feels weird about this. So I told her we find somewhere else to sleep, and I will see her at the party instead. She often sleeps here. I even hold her head while she was sick and she stayed here.

Bonus info: she have a BF and he recently moved into her apartment. He is supposedly ok with us staying. Everybody gets along fine other than this hiccup. 

Am I so pissed of how she treats me. Am I overreacting?
TL;DR:
