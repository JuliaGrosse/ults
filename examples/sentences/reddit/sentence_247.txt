SUBREDDIT: r/BreakUps
TITLE: Think I[20m] am falling for her[22f] again.
POST: So this girl and I went out for three months but we broke up(my fault, i fucked up). I moved on or at least I though I had. Thing is, she is now dating one of my best friends and now I am developing feelings again. Every time I hang out with both of them, I start to feel insanely jealous of my buddy. Normally, I would just distance myself from the situation but this is one of my really good friends and I hang out with him all the time. Could this just be a case of "the grass is always greener on the other side"? I just don't know what I should do.
