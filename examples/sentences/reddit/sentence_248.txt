TITLE: Me [32 M] with my son [8M], my son's friend [8M], son's friend's mom [30ish F], and school administrator [50ish F].
POST: Hello Reddit!  I need help dealing with my son's school system, which seems to have become a little irrational with its "zero strike" policy.

My son, Max [8M], was at school the other day and there's a new student named Sam [8M].  Apparently a bunch of kids were all around talking and getting to know each other and making jokes, and my son told Sam:  "You're a homo...  a homo *sapien*!".  Or something like that.  Just a clever little quip that the "gang" all says to each other.

Apparently Sam went home crying and now the school has suspended my son for two days.  I think this is absolutely ridiculous, as Max is a good kid and he was just trying to help Sam join the group by making a joke the same way Max and his friends make jokes with each other.  I don't want this to go on my son's record, and I'm thinking about getting my lawyer involved.  This whole thing has been hugely detrimental for Max's self esteem, who has been having a hard time anyways because his mother has been working abroad for a few weeks.  I don't want to stress him out, which would negatively impact his schoolwork.

The administrator says that the school has a "zero tolerance policy" towards bigotry, and Sam's mother says that Sam has been throwing up every morning before school because he doesn't want to get picked on.

Reddit, what should my next step be?
