TITLE: Me [17M] with my Ex [17F] broke up 6 months ago, she wrote a bunch of poems
POST: So I broke up with her after two months for a bunch of reasons that I don't really want to go into and we were friends for about two weeks after. That was until I found out that she probably cheated on me with someone who used to be my friend and blew him about 30 minutes after we broke up. Basically I told her I just didnt want to talk to her again. My friend who works for our schools  poetry and art journal showed me two poems that she submitted. They are directly about me and one of them is called "boys R dumb." She references specific things about me like how I like cool ranch doritos and that I should enjoy my new girlfriend (I have been with a different girl for the past three months and it has been awesome). 

She wrote some pretty terrible things about me that just arent true and I am not sure if I should confront her or just leave it. I am also wondering if this could end up being a problem with my new girlfriend because I am 90% sure she will read them. Is there anything I can do?
TL;DR:
