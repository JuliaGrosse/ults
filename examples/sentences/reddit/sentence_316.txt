TITLE: [25/M] Met a girl at a bar and going on first date since breakup of serious relationship, but I won't be in the same city as her for very long
POST: So, I broke up with a girl, who I was in a serious relationship with for about 3 years, 2 months ago. This past weekend I was at a bar with some friends and started chatting/dancing with a girl [26/F] and her group of friends. She seemed nice, my type (looks and personality) and I got her number. Exchanged a few texts and set up a date for next week. 

I'm leaving the country before the end of the year (work reasons) yet I still want to go on dates in the mean time to get back out in the dating scene. My question is really threefold: A) If she texted me the next day asking how the night was, is this a good sign? B) If this is a good sign and she likes me, should I disclose on this first date that I'll be leaving the country, to be up front with her and manage expectations? and C) If I don't disclose that I'll be leaving soon on the first date, is this dishonest?
TL;DR:
