TITLE: Me [18 M] and a girl I met in my college class weeks ago [18 F] - what to do in this situation?
POST: I meet her on the first day of class, we're in the same group, she gives lots of stares, laughs at my silly jokes all the time even when it's not funny, I get her number a week or two later (class is once a week) we're both clearly attracted to each other.

Now whenever class ends she tries to walk with me but is on her phone 80 percent of the time. She never has a lot to say and she is kinda shy, just like me. So sometimes it's just an awkward walk to our cars with little talk.

I haven't hugged, or even touched her as in side hug, playful touching, hand held, etc. I want to hangout casually with her before considering dating, but don't know what to do. I may go to a museum with my friend and his gf, maybe I could invite this girl? I just dont know exactly what kind of girl she is since she doesnt show much of herself. What can I do to avoid making all this awkward?

Also  escalate very far in text (she uses snapchat and knows I dont have one).
TL;DR:
