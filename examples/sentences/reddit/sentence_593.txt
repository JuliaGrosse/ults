TITLE: Me [29 M] with my girlfriend [26F] of 8 months just discovered she has a mild eating disorder.
POST: Been dating my amazing girlfriend for 8 months. She is a wonderful, extremely beautiful and caring person. She is very healthy now but yesterday she opened up to me that she sometimes makes herself purge when she eats something unhealthy. 

I starting digging in and asking her why she does this and the reason is because she hates what she sees and shes not happy with herself. I knew before we dated about 6 years ago she went down to 100lbs, could not get her period anymore. Her mom forced her to the doctor and she took away her treadmill and she wasn't allowed to see her friends until she got healthy. I thought she was over that horrible part of her life but it seems like she somewhat isn't. She eats very healthy and eats well, and shes in the gym at least 6 times a week for 1.5 hours. Its when she eats chocolate or something sugary that she wants to vomit sometimes. I'm afraid she might be relapsing. I asked her if shes seen a therapist and she said she has few times and she says they just make her angrier because it won't help. I don't want her to have low self-esteem. It hurts to know that someone you care about so much is thinking so negatively of themselves, because she doesn't realize I love her more than her looks, it truly kills me inside because she will never understand how much I love her.

I would do anything for this amazing women. She is the love of my life and I would die for her, and i can't understand how a person with that much beauty can feel that way. What can I do to help her or convince her that seeing a therapist is ok.
TL;DR:
