TITLE: Reddit, what are your best, or possibly worst, camping experiences?
POST: For me, about a year ago a few buddies and I went up to a cabin out in the middle of nowhere that very few people know about.  Our hike most of the way was through a big old winter storm coming in. Upon arrival and a few beers we decided to take our liquid courage into sledding form.  Eventually I ended up slamming into a tree (fortunately without injury).  After that we all sat around smoking cigars while looking at a mountain across the valley, and we came to the dead set conclusion that some maniac mountain man was hiking the damn thing pretty close to sunset, and thought he was for sure in for a very cold night in sub zero temps.  After that we moved our efforts into the cabin and made some delicious dinner consisting of cheese bratwursts, onions, green peppers, and whatever else we could find.  Once bed time rolled around one of my buddies tried to stumble up the ladder to the loft of the cabin, and ended up slipping off and falling around 8 feet right onto my back.  Didn't even care at this point and just started cracking up for the next few minutes.  All in all just fun with a bunch of guys in the middle of fucking nowhere.
TL;DR:
