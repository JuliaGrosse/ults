TITLE: [23/m] Attached when I shouldn't have been, and now she [23/f] has a boyfriend. She wants to stay friends. How to move on without affecting her?
POST: I broke up with a long-term girlfriend shortly before she left overseas so that we could get some matured perspective on our relationship and future together. 

Skip ahead 18 months -- We very frequently kept in contact all the while that she was abroad, and she was always vocal about her affection towards me. I never had any desire to make a move towards any other women while she was gone, and I felt that I had personally gotten the perspective on our relationship that I had initially been looking for. 

But now she's picked up a boyfriend abroad, and naturally there's some disconnection between us. 

Anyway, I'm looking to move on with my life, but she still wants us to remain close friends.

I don't think it's fair that she ought to be punished for starting a relationship with somebody else, considering she was single, so I feel guilty about completely cutting communication from her -- but I personally don't want to video call her anymore like she wants, for the sake of my own feelings and attachment. 

How best to move on without implicating her? 

FWIW: 

* Her and her new boyfriend don't share citizenship of each other's home countries. They'll either need to get married after ~4 months together, or live out the rest of their relationship long-distance. 

* I'm abroad in a separate country all together, and won't be returning home for another 12 months; giving the decision to cut all contact some extra weight.
TL;DR:
