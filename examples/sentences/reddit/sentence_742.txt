TITLE: Me [27 M] with my Girlfriend [27 F] of 5 years, I feel like our relationship is crumbling
POST: I've been in a relationship for 5 years, we just celebrated our anniversary last month. I love her or I know I did love her. We've been living together for 4 years now. 

I feel like everything is put on me, always. Rent, gas, electric, cable, and any other bill. She doesn't have her license and has never even had her permit we are both almost 30 years old and I have to drive her everywhere. 

I think I blame her for everything just as a way to cope with my crushing feeling of never being able to escape from my situation.
