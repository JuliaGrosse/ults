TITLE: Is it bad that I get so worked up looking at coworkers/coeds/colleagues' work that I actively avoid exposing myself to it?
POST: I've never been able to quite identify why, but I've always hated being shown other students/coworkers/colleagues' work or accomplishments. As a web designer/developer, this sort of comparing/contrasting/exchanging of others' work and ideas seems to be a core concept in my field, but I've just never really enjoyed it. My friends and colleagues are constantly seeking out awesome new examples of stuff that others have posted on various 'creative'-centered sites, saying things like, "Look how talented this guy is!" "Isn't their work awesome?", but meanwhile my gut response is always to look for flaws in what I'm shown, to bring them down to earth rather than hoist them further up on a pedestal with more praise. I just don't see the point in looking at something that's much better than what I've done, since it just reminds me of how far below them I am and how much farther I have to go to catch up.

I honestly wouldn't think much of it, except that I wonder if this attitude of mine may end up isolating me creatively and cause my own work to stagnate and suffer. Is this a valid concern? If so, how can I adjust my attitude towards others' work so it's not something I actively avoid?
TL;DR:
