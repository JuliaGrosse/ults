TITLE: Any experience with Feliway?
POST: My poor cat (~1yr old calico) has problems peeing--it might be crystals.  I'm currently working with a vet and changing her diet etc.    One thing that was suggested was Feliway.   

The Vet said that she might not be getting enough water.  This cat drinks more water than any cat I've ever seen, and I was giving her wet food twice a day as well.  Before she was having problems urinating she'd PEE SO MUCH!  Like massive clumps of urine that she'd play with if I didn't scoop them straight away (my kitten is a dirtball).    I'm wondering if maybe she misses me and is drinking less when I'm not around and I'm not really noticing it.  If this is the case I want to try Feliway.  (My mom, a vet tech recommends it as well).  

For my cat's first 7 months with me (she followed me home off the street) I was working from home, this month, I started working a "real" job and am away for 9 hours.  I do make an effort to play with her a bit when I get home, but she's such a cuddle bug that we wind up just cuddling and watching TV.   

It's hard to tell if she is stressed with me leaving, because she is SUCH A CHILL LITTLE GIRL.  She's playful at the right times, cuddly when I want her to be, and she's so good at the vet--only slightly "normal" nervous.  
I'm not having issues with her peeing outside the box; I just want to make her less stressed.  

Sorry, on with the questions,  have you guys used Feliway?  Where do I plug it in?   My apartment is the first floor of a row home and she's allowed everywhere.
TL;DR:
