TITLE: Might be a victim of identity theft but have never used any services from a bank
POST: I was looking to open my first credit card a few weeks ago and the clerk informed me that my SSN was used by another person at the same bank to open an account. He was very reserved about what he could and could not disclose to me about the person even after I went to the SS office for a verification of my number. Instead of opening a credit card like I had hoped, the representative suggested a debit card which is what I have currently. However, I am still in the dark when it  comes to the standing of my credit. Although my first personal and legitimate transaction with any sort of bank only recently occurred, it seems as if someone has already opened at least one account under my name. I've attempted to call TransUnion and made an account on their website to try to smooth out my identity theft mishap but they require a credit card number to go any further. I might be a little paranoid because this is my first stab into finance, so I need another take on my situation. What should I do from here? I know somebody other than myself is in possession of my SSN but I'm feeling helpless about what I can do about it since everything I've looked up on comes back to establishing a credit report first.
TL;DR:
