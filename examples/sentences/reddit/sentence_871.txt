TITLE: Hi faceless friends/should I be a police officer?
POST: So, yes, I have resorted to anonymous posts or inbox replies from strangers...but, I think I need to be a police officer/detective. I was raised on VERY religious/strict backgrounds so I rebelled and tried somethings while I was a young adult. I went to college and have a B.S. in criminal justice administration. I then decided social work is more proactive, but still have a huge desire/draw to be an officer. Am I wasting time as a female if I try? And also, what's the paperwork ratio? For people involved in our system, what's the 'better' work to handle? I do supervised visitations, but am NOT CPS, and I am always looking out for clients. Wouldn't want to lose that respect as a cop, and desire that field...a lot!
TL;DR:
