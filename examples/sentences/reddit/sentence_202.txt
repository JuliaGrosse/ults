SUBREDDIT: r/Advice
TITLE: Boyfriend and the stip club.
POST: So... My boyfriend of a year and half is in Florida for work. Tonight is his last night there and he mentioned that one of his work buddies wanted to take him to the strip club. I feel uneasy with it. And I told him my feelings on it... but he sounded a bit upset. I didn't tell him he couldn't go. Because that isn't how are relationship is. But maybe I should change my feelings toward it?

So my questions are here: 
1.) Is going to the strip club on the verge of cheating?
2.) Should I feel uneasy or should I just trust he is going to stare at some butts and stuff..
TL;DR:
