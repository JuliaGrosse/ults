TITLE: I (24/F) want to effectively communicate with boyfriend (30/M) that his recent behavior leaves me feeling neglected.
POST: I've been dating current boyfriend for a little over two months and things have been great. He's funny, charming, and usually very thoughtful. However, recently things have changed a bit.

He's been extremely busy at work -- a lot of people recently moved on to new organizations in his office so he's handling a lot more than his normal work load -- and I'm trying to be as supportive as possible because I know he's so stressed and wants to do a good job. 

However he's recently been cutting out on our plans without giving me a heads up, so I end up waiting to hear from him for hours at a time because I think our plans are still on. When he does get in touch with me he's really apologetic and citing that work kept him away, but it feels like being stood up every time, and it's hurtful. I feel like I'm no longer a priority for him. 

It also seems to be reopening old wounds. My previous (and first) long term relationship ended over a year and a half ago for similar reasons (the straw on the camel's back being that ex was supposed to pick me up from an international airport when I came to visit him during a semester abroad and showed up almost 6 hours late). 

I don't want to be in another relationship where I'm simply an option, but I don't know how to talk to him about it in order to convey this. Do I bring up the past baggage? Do I simply address the surface issue? Help!
TL;DR:
