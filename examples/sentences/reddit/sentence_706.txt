TITLE: My [22f] boyfriend [21m] wants to sleep with other women.
POST: I came out of lurking to ask this one. Two days ago I found out my boyfriend wants to sleep with other women. I was at his place and went to use his computer. His gmail was open and I saw a conversation he had on gchat with his friend.

He was basically complaining that he loves me and finds me attractive but he wants to sleep with other women as well. He went on about how great he thought I was and that he was still attracted to me, but he couldn't help wanting to sleep with other women he found attractive, but he wants to be in a relationship with me. From the conversation I gathered he hasn't cheated on me, but I feel like it's inevitable. 

I don't even know how to confront him about it because I invaded his privacy and that's the only reason I found out. I really love him, but I can't help but wonder when he'll just go and sleep with someone behind my back.
TL;DR:
