TITLE: My [22M] new girlfriend [21F] may be schizophrenic.
POST: My girlfriend of two months acts much like an average anime obsessed, introverted millennial. We hit it off immediately from our first date, and my friends all think she's awesome.

On New Year's eve, I invited a few people over to drink in the new year. 3am rolled around and we all called I a night. We went to bed and she immediately passed out. Being the drunk idiot I was, I tried to wake her up to get some lovin' on...

She woke up and started crying, hugging her knees, and saying, "I'm dead. I'm dead. I really should be dead. Why don't you just kill me?" My brother had night terrors when we were little, so I figured that's what it was... I just held her and told her everything was all right and I was there. I never told her about that.

A few nights ago, I had everyone over drinking again. I passed out on the couch and she stayed up... And apparently went through another one of those episodes with only my friends, clueless, thinking she might be on drugs.

After I heard about it, I asked her if she had night terrors or sleep walked or even talked in her sleep. She said she didn't.

My friend who's in the mental health field says it looked like a schizophrenic episode... And I don't know what to do about it.
TL;DR:
