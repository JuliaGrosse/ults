TITLE: My [20M] second date with a girl [20F] ended with a hug, not a kiss. But she said she wanted to see me again after finals/winter break end?
POST: Last night I went on a really great second date with a girl. Despite it being reading period, with finals approaching next week, we went to see a comedy show, and then got hot chocolate at a coffee shop afterwards and talked until closing. I walked her home afterwards.

At the end of the date I really wanted to kiss her, and I started moving my hands towards her waist to hold her, but before I could do anything else she leaned in and gave me a tight hug, and told me she wanted to hang out with me again after winter break.

Did she not want to kiss? Or did she just misread it as a hug?
TL;DR:
