TITLE: Weird situation. GF [23F] is upset with me [23M] for playing with a cursed video game controller.
POST: I really don't know where to begin here. My girlfriend and I both live with her parents in order to save money and pay off our student loans faster, but we both work and I think we do the whole adulting thing pretty well. My girlfriend is NOT a superstitious person. She does not believe in ghosts or anything paranormal and is a highly rational person about everything except this. 

A couple of weeks ago we were rooting around in the attic and we found her old Playstation 2 in a big box with all its games and accessories. Score. We set everything up and gamed the night away. It's important to note that there were three controllers, two that we used and a third one that was kept in a separate box that was taped shut. I asked her about it and she said "We don't play with that one. It's cursed." Apparently when she was a kid she noticed a pattern of friends and family members getting into car accidents shortly after she would play a game with the controller. After her uncle was in a fatal accident (he didn't die, but the driver of the other car did) she put away the controller for good.

Like I said, my girlfriend is a very rational person who does not believe in anything supernatural. She even sounded like she was half-joking/embarrassed about it so I didn't think it was that serious. That weekend I invited a friend over to hang out and we decided to play some Playstation. Some buttons on one of the ""uncursed"" controllers were sticking and making it hard to play, so I swapped it out with the ""cursed"" controller and let my friend play with it instead. 

I honestly thought it was not a big deal and that my gf understood that the whole curse thing was just an irrational thing from her childhood. But she was actually kind of upset when she got home and saw it plugged in. She's boxed up the
