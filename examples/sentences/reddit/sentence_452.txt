TITLE: Bought my first masturbator toy... is that odd?
POST: First of all... not sure if this is in the right subreddit. Potentially NSFW.

Throw away account due to friends knowing about my primary account and don't want them to think I am a freak :)

I'll start with a brief background... I am a male and grew up going to a very, very (stress on the very) catholic elementary, middle and high school. Certainly, masturbation was highly looked down upon. This school was pretty secluded from the real world. After finishing 9th grade, the school fell into debt and was forced to close down. Upon arriving at a far less catholic school, I discovered the art and the beauty of masturbation. Since then I have been doing the mundane, and typical masturbation techniques. 

After finishing my first semester at college, my thrill for risk has increased all around, one of the areas included masturbation. 

As of about 30 minutes ago, I ordered a pocket pussy. I was kinda interested and decided to go for it. Is that strange? I've been raised to think masturbation alone is morally wrong (currently, I couldn't give two fucks if it is or not) but there is still that thought in the back of my mind... 

I realize this makes me sound like a weirdo. And frankly, I don't care if it does make me weird, I just wanna know for sure if it does or not... if that makes sense.
TL;DR:
