TITLE: retail revenge
POST: so I work at a semi-high class department store where i deal with mens fashion so i help customers pick out shirts, pants, suits etc.

most of our shirts are in packages so as an unwritten rule we inform the customers that we have a trial shirt rack which they can try on the brand of shirt they wish to buy because they all have the same cut.

Once in a while we have customers come in and want to try on a shirt but we don't have their size on the trial rack so we (the team members) open the shirts up for the customer. The customer that i served a few hours ago had to have a shirt open (size 46cm neck) for him which I did happily for him.

So he went off and tried on the shirt and everything and it was the right fit. He comes to the counter and lo and behold is carrying another packaged size 46. Where is the other 46 that i had opened for him? I found it lying in the changing room.

This customer wanted a band new packaged shirt instead of the one he tried on. For one this is not very hygienic so i quickly plotted my revenge. He decided that he still wanted to do more shopping so i left him to his own devices and while he was not looking, i repackaged the shirt he tried on and returned the brand new one back to the racks. The kicker...

I repacked his shirt upside down in the package. He didn't know the difference. Take that
TL;DR:
