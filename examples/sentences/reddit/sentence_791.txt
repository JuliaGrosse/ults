SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice
TITLE: Am I completely undateable?
POST: Firstly, I apologize if I'm in the wrong sub-reddit, the rules seem to suggest this post is okay.

I'm 21 year olds, and I'm a shy and quiet guy - at least when I first meet people, quite thin and socially awkward when I first meet people (due to severe bullying at school, 5 years ago). I have been told I look "okay" but I'm certainly not a Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, probably a below-average looker at best.

I have been told by my past girlfriends (nearly 4 years ago since I last had a girlfriend...) that I'm a "nice guy" and come across as "very caring".

I have always had a strong desire to be in a relationship with someone but have always struggled to find the places to meet women and to actually have the confidence to talk to them and have anything interesting to say (I find it difficult to start conversations and keep them going).

My biggest worry is this 4 year period between now and my last girlfriend will turn into 10 years, then 20 years, then death.

I think that because of school, and the bullying that followed me for more than 10 years during my time at school, I have no real concept of body language, what to do or how to do things and it's really frustrating.
TL;DR:
