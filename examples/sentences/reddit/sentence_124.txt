TITLE: I'm 32, husband is 35, and he has recently registered for several casual sex/fling websites.
POST: I'm 32, my husband is 35 (almost 36), and we've been married for 10 years.  I have access to his e-mail because he gave me his password, but he must have forgotten that he gave me his password because he has recently registered for 4 or 5 of these "casual dating" websites.  So far, he hasn't cheated (that I know of). I don't know what to do. He constantly says he loves me and we have a pretty good sex life. Do I confront him? Wait until he cheats? Get out now? I do LOVE him.  I want to be with him and I want everything to be okay. Part of me thinks that if he hasn't cheated then I should just let it slide, but I know that I don't deserve this.  I am lost.
TL;DR:
