TITLE: I [16m] went on a double date today. She left early(will explain in text box) she hasn't responded to my texts. What do I do?
POST: By texts i dont mean a mass sending of texts just 2 texts.We went to the mall today to just walk and get something to eat, we held hands hugged and were really playful. She was with her friend who was with my brother and for some reason her friend brought her little sister.

Her sister had to leave early for a surgery(what I was told and if I remember correctly she told me that her friend's sister had to go to the doctor) and she said she'd be back but she called me and said they have to go too for support. 

Now it's understandable that my date had to go as well because her friend was the ride. I texted her after she left saying it was fine I understand. 

She asked if we were leaving the mall I said yes and she said "oh ok"
Now she isn't a enthusiastic texter and always texts short and breif messages. I texted back saying "I enjoyed the time we had spent together though and I hope we can do it again." 

She said yeah me too and then I texted back and she never answered. It's 12 am here and that was at 3pm. She's probably busy but I have a habit of fucking things up so Im just worried that it may be finished. Should I attempt to text her again in the morning or early afternoon? What should i take from this? Sorry for the long post.
TL;DR:
