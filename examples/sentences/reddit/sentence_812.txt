SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I, 18F, have been seeing 35M for about 2 months now, and it's been great, but I don't know where to go from here.
POST: We met the week before I left for 5 weeks, and spent hours together pretty much every day before I left. We've talked constantly since I've been away, and I get home on Sunday. 

We started out wanting something casual, but after the first time we were together, it became pretty clear that wasn't an option. The feelings are there, the sex is great, he's really good to me, but it feels like there can't be a future. 

We've established that we both really care about one another, and we want to spend as much time together as possible, but I don't know where this is going. I'm going to college across the country in the fall, and I won't be home until Thanksgiving. 

The age difference is an obvious issue, but I'm mature for my age and very independent. He still acts like he's in his twenties, so that hasn't been a problem. I've never been attracted to guys my own age, and I have been so happy since we started seeing each other. 

I definitely don't want to stop seeing him, but it feels strange carrying on knowing that I'm leaving in a month. He said that he can come visit, but 
I don't think I want to keep up a long distance thing while I'm starting out somewhere new. 

Thoughts?
TL;DR:
