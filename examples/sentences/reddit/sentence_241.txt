TITLE: Me [19 M] with my ex [18F] 1 year, do you ever fully get over it and not care anymore?
POST: Okay so we dated for a year, I found out she was using me to get close to my brother and then was cheating on me with him our last few months. We broke up, shes been out of my life for almost a year now.

Do you ever fully get over it? I dont think about it as much but every time i hear about my brother I just get so fucking angry and bitter. When I get close with girls now i just dont really trust them anymore. I know im more mature and healthier and I don't get bedridden or depressed from what happened anymore, but I still have that nagging feeling from it. I still get dreams about her and wake up pissed and sad for the rest of the day. I still dont really like myself and dont feel lovable. I was just wondering if anyone else went through this and if you ever TRULY get fully over it, or if its just kind of a weight adults learn to carry.
TL;DR:
