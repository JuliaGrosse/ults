SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My coworker [22 M] and I [21 F] have been hooking up consistently for almost three years.
POST: Not a very interesting story, but it's been confusing enough for me to post, and I don't know where to go from here. My coworker and I have been hooking up consistently for about three years now, even when we would be somewhat seeing or interested in other people (though haven't dated anyone else.) We've never really talked about it, but we're really close and spend time hanging out together (going hiking, going to parties, etc.) but we've never considered dating (at least I haven't.) 

The other night we were walking home from a party and things got heated and then he stopped and said that we should talk soon and that he was "thinking of me differently." We haven't talked about it sense but yesterday while we were leaving work he said "I love you," while we were saying goodbye and hugged me for an unusual amount of time, and that was somewhat atypical though it didn't seem super serious. I'm just really confused because this has been happening for so long but when we're around each other it's like nothing has really changed. Not sure what to make of that night or what to expect.
TL;DR:
