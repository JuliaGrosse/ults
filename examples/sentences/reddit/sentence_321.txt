TITLE: Would this help to end world poverty?
POST: I noticed girls posting statuses on facebook of them claiming to go to a country for an allotted time. Upon further research, I found that the enigmatic statuses were to create awareness for breast cancer. 

 I also discovered that similar status trends have happened in the past, such as naming their bra colour for breast cancer, and people changing their profile picture to their favourite cartoon to end child abuse.

Looking at the numbers, it seems to have worked. Funding for breast cancer is in the millions every year, and I asked some people if they knew about child abuse and they told me that it was a reality. Clearly the statuses worked!

Now reddit, I am asking you if we can use this technique to decimate poverty from Africa. I was thinking we should make our statuses in such a way that we mention our *favourite food* and say that we eat it on *whatever object is directly to our right*. 

In my case, "I eat sushi on my guitar"

If we band together, we just might have enough statuses to cause an end to hunger!
TL;DR:
