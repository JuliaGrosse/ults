SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [M 20] and my GF [F 19] of 1 yr started dating as Christians, I have recently lost my faith, and I know that she will break up with me if I'm not a Christian.
POST: We have been absolutely inseparable since we met 2 years ago at college. We were best friends all of freshman year, and decided to start dating our sophomore year. It's been absolutely wonderful, and throughout it all I've always considered myself a Christian, even if it was on a lesser scale than her faith. 

There would be times where she would break down in tears about how we never read the Bible together or how she didn't feel that she was growing in Christ, and so on, and I would sincerely feel awful and try to be a better Christian.

So this past summer we are studying abroad in different countries, and at the beginning we would use the summer apart to "find ourselves" spiritually. It's been weird having conversations about (lack of) faith over skype and stuff, so we've kinda ignored it. Her faith has stayed the same, while I've pretty much confirmed that I'm agnostic. 

I need to tell her at some point, but it's so hard. She's been my best friend for two years, and one of only a couple friends I have at college. It will be a very lonely semester if I decide to tell her.
TL;DR:
