TITLE: Me [17M] concerned about age gap with a potential girlfriend
POST: I am an exchange student in a foreign country this year, and in the next few days i will be going out with a girl that i met recently.
My concern is the age difference and wonder what you guys think about it. I am 17 and will be turning 18 in 2 months, she is 16 and her birthday isnt until november. 

So i am 1.5 years older than her and it makes me a bit unsure, even though when i met her i assumed she was 17/18 based on her looks.

I recently read a post about some girl (15) that was going out with a guy that was like 24. I know that is totally different but just reading the stuff about how the family was very concerned etc puts me off. Because there *would* be a period of a few months where i am 18 and she is 16, and i worry about the connotations of that and what her family etc would think.
TL;DR:
