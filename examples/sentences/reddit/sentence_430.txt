TITLE: Friend that i have feelings for just got into a relationship. Do i tell them how i feel, or forever hold my silence?
POST: So, i'm crazy about a person who also happens to be a good friend. In the beginning, we really hit it off and most of our friends thought we would definitetly get together, just a matter of time. But i've known him for over a year now and nothing doing...we are both quite shy. We talk a lot and share stuff, whenever we're together there's a lot of accidentally-on-purpose physical content...tension etc...friends who didn't even know i had feelings for him would always say he was being really obvious...you get the picture. recently, i found out that he was seeing someone casually, but he told me that he wasn't that into her, he just knew she liked him and he wanted to be with someone...i was bursting to tell him that she wasn't his only option...but i didn't. he was still being very affectionate with me and i thought he might still choose me. now they are together and i'm gutted. i feel he has led me on. do i confront him? what do i say? 
Reddit, thanks so much for reading this - please give me some advice!
