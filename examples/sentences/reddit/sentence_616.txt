SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [24M] with my ex [23F] of 3 years, she sent me a big bag of bad etiquette.
POST: After the breakup, I sent her, via mutual friends, a bag of her stuff that she left at my house. She sent in return, a bag of gifts I gave to her, including a t-shirt which still stunk of her sweat. Couldn't even launder it before sending it back. I know I didn't send her any dirty clothes.

Furthermore, she didn't send ALL the gifts I gave to her, just, I guess, the ones she didn't want.

Is she trying to make me feel even worse? Does she not understand breakup etiquette? Do I not understand it? Am I missing something here? Am I warranted in feeling so insulted or am I just looking for something to be mad about because I'm so hurt by the breakup itself?
TL;DR:
