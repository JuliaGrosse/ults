TITLE: TIFU by using the handicap restroom stall. (NSFW)
POST: When I use the restroom at my school, I make sure it is the best experience I can possibly get out of it. You see, my philosophy is, if you're gonna use the restroom in public, make it so it feels like you're at home. So I'm at my school library, as we speak, and just a little while ago I had to use it pretty bad. I walked into the restroom and stood there at my vast amount of available stalls. During that time, no one was in there but me, so I thought to myself, "If I choose the one closes to the door, people can see me through the stalls slit as they walk in and smell the aroma I would give off, and also hear the bass I would be dropping. If I went to middle stalls, they're more then likely dirty." So I thought, the handicap stall!! Today, I'm going use the restroom like a king. With no respect for my fellow handicap colleague, I swung that stall door open, slid my jeans and underwear off. (I'm a brief type of guy!) I went full commando. The nice breeze from the ventilation was heavenly. As I comfortable sat down. I began to what only one can call, the moment of relief. At that moment, I heard the restroom door open. What seems to be only none other then a sound of a wheel chair rolling through. I froze. Embarrassment swallowed me whole. The sound grew louder and it came closer. A struggle ensued, as the gentlemen wrestled trying to get the stall open, his eyes lined up with the stall slit. I knew, he knew, that I knew, I was not handicap. I felt ashamed. I also felt violated. I couldn't yell, I couldn't even speak up to tell him to stop staring or, "can I help you sir?" We locked eyes, and perhaps he even saw me for what I am worth. He left moments later. I sat there hopeless, scared, humiliated. I no longer needed to use the restroom. I wiped, rose up, gather myself, and returned to my little cubicle to continue studying,... I can help but to feel my innocence is lost.
TL;DR:
