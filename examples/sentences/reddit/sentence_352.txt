TITLE: Roommate accuses me of stealing.
POST: We're both 19f, been living together for 6 months. We were friends at the beginning, always borrowing each others things. We'd always ask first though. Then we went through an awkward faze of not talking. We got over that. During that period though, she would tweet things that I felt were obviously related to me. For example she tweeted "I smell a theif" and then a day later all her food from the kitchen was stored in her room. I have NEVER touched any of her food...ever! And now she'll ask me "hey..do you have my black shirt with the lace.." ex..and I wont have it because I never took it but she'll act like she doesn't believe me. And then she'll tweet.."I strongly dislike people who take my stuff without asking." So I texted her just being like.."Hey, I hope you don't think im holding out on you. I have given all your clothing back that I've borrowed, and I haven't taken anything without asking. I just don't want you thinking im lying to you!" and all she responded was.."lol nah its all good. it will probably show up somewhere. " 
 So I don't know where to go from here. I was then like.."Okay, well I have 5 and I dont where 2 of them anymore, so if you need one you can have one! :)" and she was like.."lol ok." 

 So this is so awkward for me, and I know she's telling her friends its me. I don't know where to go from here. Or if there is anything else I can do.
TL;DR:
