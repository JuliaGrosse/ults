TITLE: How do I [21 F] go about telling my parents / family that I do not want children...?
POST: Hi Reddit!
This is the first time I've posted in r/relationships...And I was hoping you guys could give me a little insight as it seems you guys have good advice.

Ok so, a little background first...I'm an only child and even though I'm 21, I know I do not want kids...

This is mainly because of health issues that I know I have / have had in the past that are hereditary.
But it is also because I just don't want kids. I don't think I'd be the best mother for various other reasons and I'm completely content to spend my life with my boyfriend, also 21, without us having children together.
(He also doesn't want kids.)

My biggest issue and the stress I'm having is based around that I'm an only child and I know that hearing that I, my parents only kid together, don't want to have kids is going to be hard for my family, especially my Dad, to hear...

So my question is this: 
Is there any way to make this information easier for them?
How should I even go about telling them?

(I never really talked in depth with them about having or not having kids, I've always guessed they assumed / hoped that I would have kids in the future based on how they talked about the subject when it was brought up by other family members.)

Also, if it's worth mentioning, my parents have been divorced for years and my Mom is remarried / my Dad has a girlfriend...So the two of them having another kid together is pretty impossible. Haha.
TL;DR:
