TITLE: Me [17 M] the past two weeks I've been hearing things that aren't there, and i have don't know when i'm dreaming or when i'm awake!?
POST: i've noticed this happening lately, when i have my headphones on i'll hear a deep gutteral voice call out my name from the other room, i'll walk in and no one will be there  no one is home. 

i have never taken any illegal drugs (i did take lexapro for about two years when i was 14-15 for anxiety and depression) i have an uncle who is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. i have read that it is hereditary so i'm not sure what to think.

yesterday, or today i don't know it felt like i was dreaming while i was awake. i saw stars while the sun was out but saw my family as clear as day. 

I drove to work and all the other cars were frozen in place. i just drove through them like ghosts and when i got to work it felt like i was shaken awake out of bed because my manager called asking where the hell i was.

i'm really confused right now, i have a therapist i see once a month, i bumped the meeting up next tuesday which was the earliest she could see me. i've taken break from work until i can figure this all out.. my question is how should i approach my therapist about this? she told me upfront if she thinks i'm a danger to myself or others she has to report me to the police. i don't want to be locked up in a insane asylum. how do i tell her this without being taken away???
TL;DR:
