TITLE: TIFU by destroying a $1200 laptop with all my school work on it
POST: Short and sweet. I just finished my 2nd year of college so i finally have time to myself so i decide to re sub to wow and chat with some old friends. I'm playing it enjoying it when i get the thought...."i should totally get a coffee". So naturally i did..... i'm sipping my coffee finishing some quests when i put my coffee onto the coaster. See this is where it gets good my dad has these super shitty coasters that are barley the size of the bottom of the cup. I misplaced this cup by an eighth of an inch and it tips over, all over the right hand side of my laptop. I freak the fuck out i pull the power cable slam down the power button like i was trying to suffocate an M&M and run downstairs. I grab a towel and blanket this thing while tipping it upside down to ensure all the coffee could escape. My mom lysols the fuck out of the keyboard which i feel could have caused some damage to it on its own. We use compressed air and ensure everything is gone. After waiting 30 or so minutes my mom insists we turn it on and it does. I turn it on to ensure the keys are working and everything is, its as good as the day i got it. I originally wanted to turn it on see if everything works then immediately off but some guildies needed help with shit so i got back into the game. Not even 20 minutes in the screen blacks out and stops working. The computer continues to try and boot itself back up again only to fail at the dell logo. I pressed the power down to ensure it was off. I waited another hour i go to turn it on and nothing its dead and so are my dreams.
TL;DR:
