TITLE: Me [20M] with my long distance GF [20F] are having communication issues after one month
POST: My girlfriend was a very close friend of mine in high school. There was always something there, but we never initiated anything until summer of 2013. We had a little fling, and we stopped talking after I had the wrong idea about where it was going. 

We started talking again this summer, and I went to hang out with her while she was in our hometown. Nothing happened, no kissing or anything of the sort. All we did was bake brownies and watch the world cup. It was magical, and we reconnected. We then started talking for the next month as she went overseas to visit her dad. We would talk all of the time about everything and nothing. 

I planned to visit her at her school, and we spent a total of 12 days together, after which we decided that we would try a committed relationship. 

Things were great, but recently, she has stopped talking to me as frequently. She cites her phone as being the issue, as the bottom of the phone does not respond to touch. She is getting a new phone soon, and I hope that will help, but neither of us are convinced that communication will go back up, mainly because she could communicate through her laptop if she wanted to. 

My biggest hang up is that I feel that we are losing the initial spark, but maybe we are just transitioning from the "honeymoon phase."

I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what we should do to recreate that spark, or advice for me to deal with having less immediate communication like I am used to. I have visited her once a couple weeks ago, and I will be visiting her again in two weeks. We go to colleges that are a flight away, but my financial situation and airline mileage is such that it is not a problem.
TL;DR:
