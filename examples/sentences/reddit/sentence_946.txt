SUBREDDIT: r/relationship_advice
TITLE: In a relationship for 3 months, my girlfriend is already talking about apartment, marriage, and kids. I could use some advice please.
POST: I am a [27/m] in my senior year of college. I have been single for the past 5 years due to bad luck, too busy with school, and not wanting a relationship. I met my girlfriend [26/f] through my previous job. She is a single mother with a 3 year old. 

I care for her a lot. I have had serious relationships, and just playful ones, but this has been the best relationship I have ever had. She has said she loves me on numerous occasions and i don't doubt her truthfulness. I am starting to fall in love with her. Recently she has started talking about getting a place together, and getting married, and is really wanting children. I am all for the idea of having an apartment, but she wants to rush the marriage and kids bit. I have my hesitations because it has been so long since i have been committed to someone. I do want these things with her, but not yet. I will be ready for it, but not now.

My question is this. How do i talk to her and tell her I don't want kids right now? Is this cause for alarm? I don't want to get her upset, and I don't want this relationship to be over.
TL;DR:
