TITLE: M (25) torn between two F (25). Need an external perspective!
POST: So this situation has been going on too long! And I can't seem to stop it. I feel terrible about it...

After being friends for some years, about 5 months ago I started causally dating girl X (25). She's fun, supportive, we get on really well, the sex is incredible and we share mutual friends. 

However, 3 months ago I moved 2 hours away for a new job. I'm new to the area and don't have many friends here...

One night I met new girl Y (25). She's beautiful, fun and intelligent. We also share a lot of interests and get on well together... However currently she has'shit' going on in her life (parents devoice, battling bulimia and depression) and I feel like her negativity is rubbing off on me and she is relying on me to be there as a 'crutch' for her.

I think about both girls and like them! Both want to progress our relationship 'to the next level'. Ahhh my heads a mess!!!!

Has anyone ever been in a similar situ? Or can offer some words of advice?
TL;DR:
