TITLE: Should I [21 M] meet my (recently) ex girlfriend [22 F] for coffee tomorrow? [x-post /r/BIFU]
POST: Long story short: we've been in a kind of shitty relationship (about 1 year) that ended five days ago. She basically told me she doesn't love me anymore, and still has unresolved feelings for a (completely unavailable) high school crush. Tearful breakup ensued, anger, depression, bargaining, all that horribly unstable jazz. I've been trying my hardest to cope with the loss of companionship, even though every objective part of my brain tells me I did the right thing.

Two days ago, she contacted me asking to see how I'm doing. I replied and told her that I wasn't ready to start up a conversation again, that I need more time to recuperate. Yesterday I contacted her wondering how she was doing, and briefly asked if she wanted to sit down for coffee tomorrow afternoon (two days later). She said yes, and the plan was made.

I originally felt like this tiny, desperate, lonely part of me was hoping to get her back, and now I'm trying to override that and admit that I had my reasons to leave too. I wanted to talk to her to "clear the air" - make sure that the breakup (and the feelings behind them) was real and not as exaggerated as a late night and two glasses of wine can make it.

I sincerely want to be friends with her someday. She's a cool person but I definitely don't want to date her again (says the objective/rational part of my brain).

Here's my question: I'm fully aware that there's a light at the end of the tunnel (even if there are times I lose sight of it). Would talking to her so soon be counter-productive to both my feelings and our friendship?
TL;DR:
