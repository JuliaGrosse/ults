TITLE: Me [23 F] with my boyfriend [23 M] 3 years, when do I break up with him and move out
POST: I have my reasons for breaking up with him and we have tried talking through some of them. However, I have come to realize I just have to end it. Details here (if you want them): 

The hard part is that he is out of town and has been for months, I was originally fine with waiting a month for him to come back. He should have been home already. Now he isn't getting back for another month and I am ready to start moving on. 

I am now seriously debating at least moving out before he comes back and maybe ending the relationship too. I originally was going to wait so I would feel like I gave him a fair chance and so I/we could end it in person. 

Thinking on it now, it will be a thousand times harder to move out once he is back since he probably won't have work and will be around constantly. I have a feeling I might not be able to get the guts to move out once he is back because old habits die hard and what not. I also do not want to feel guilty about this because I know it is the right thing to do for me to be happier and healthier. 

Basically any suggestions/comments/encouragement would be awesome.
TL;DR:
