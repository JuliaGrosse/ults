TITLE: [22M] Asking a classmate out too soon?
POST: Alright, so I'll make this as brief as I can. Recently (Christmas) went through a nasty breakup, where my ex flipped a switch from sweet to insane one drunken night 6 months into our relationship. Won't go into crazy detail, but it involved a lot of yelling (from her) and throwing shit into the street (from her).

As of late, I've been in a sort of distraction phase. The semester just started and I'm taking 7 classes. I'm also working two part-time jobs, hitting the gym pretty hard, and attending 3 gym classes that add up to 8 hours a week alone. I've done well at staying positive; perhaps even better than when I was dating this girl.

In any case, I've gone from plenty of free time to almost none. Inevitably, this leads to (what I feel is) no time for any sort of intimate interest or fling. However, a girl in one of my classes has, at the very least, sparked my curiosity. I have only interacted with her twice; we were grouped together in our recitation, but from that, I've seen that she's cute, easy to talk to, nice laugh/smile, blah blah. I'm interested.

I don't know how to approach it. I don't know *if* I should approach it. Interest that isn't returned leads to awkward eye contact for the rest of the semester (in a class around 20 people). Plus, I'm still battling the post-breakup slump AND have around 10 hours of free time a week, most of which is dedicated to studying.

Was just looking for a couple thoughts on how/if to proceed. Thanks for reading!
TL;DR:
