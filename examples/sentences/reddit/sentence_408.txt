TITLE: Is it a bad idea to move straight out of your parents and in with your SO?
POST: My boyfriend (21) and I (22) have been together several years, but I go to school in Toronto and he lives in our hometown an hour and a half away. Now he's graduating and has some great job prospects out here, and we've been talking all year about moving in together - but his parents are unsure. They think he should live alone or have roommates first. The problem is, rent is expensive here, and living with me we will each save between $50-$250 a month, without being stuck in a lease. Plus, we can adjust the rent between the two of us at any point while he gets his career started since I'd already be saving so much. He's also nervous about new roommates because he's a real quiet guy who likes things clean and gets along better with females than males. With me he'd be living with two very clean female roommates he already knows well. Most of all, after having to commute to each other weekly for 8 months of the year, we'd like to be able to share more of our lives together, and we feel we're ready as a couple. But I see their point that it's an experience he may not get again. We do plan to have our whole lives together, but then again, we'll probably just end up staying at each other's places all the time anyway, and pay double the rent for it. It's his big life change, so I've left it up to him now. He says he wants to move in here, but I'm just being the paranoid girlfriend who worries if his parents have a point. Thoughts?
TL;DR:
