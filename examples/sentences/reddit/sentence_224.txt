TITLE: Is my ex-boyfriend [30 M] a narcissist?
POST: I had a horrible break up with my ex-boyfriend. He played with me, did horrible things to me, he humiliated me and used me. I felt so ashamed and horrible so when he apologised I went back to him because I wanted to get rid of this horrible feelings. He of course just used this for his next abuse.
Eventually, it was a friend of mine who told me that he is having another girlfriend. They already booked their holidays together, so they must have been together for a while. I was so shattered. When I told him that I know what was going on, he just answered, oh well I don't know why you know that but it is kinda true, I never lied to you or played with you, all the best. He did not even want to talk to me in person anymore. The last time I saw him was around 10 days ago and he pretended to be so in to me. I did not understand the world anymore. I assumed that something is wrong but everytime I asked him about it, he just told me that I am shellfish and that I think that the entire world is turning around me. But he has never done anything wrong. 
They are still together now, he is still so crazy in love. He posts pictures and talks about her openly the entire time. He is so proud of having her (she was his friend's girlfriend before so that is maybe why). He never did that with me, at the beginning he introduced me to his friends but he started to hide me soon after that. 
I still suffer from what he has done to me. I feel humiliated, used and worthless. I feel ashamed and have anger attacks.
I know that I was na√Øve and stupid but could it be that my ex-boyfriend is a narcissist and treats everyone like this eventually? Or is it purely my fault what happened?
