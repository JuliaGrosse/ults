TITLE: Quick Please- I have to be at work in 30 minutes, but yesterday I made too many mistakes and was told to go home with 45 minutes left on my shift. Was I fired? Should I go in today?
POST: There was a rush, and the shake machine broke thus things got laggy and I screwed up. I was trying to fix it, but I just made a mess using a broken shake machine and I couldn't explain quick enough why this food was in this bag and how so-and-so thought it was order X but it was order B and B has been waiting for so long b/c of the machine being broken and that's why it's messed up etc. Yeah... so She told me to just go home, and I left.

Am I fired? I don't wanna be... but I know they hate me there b/c I'm not fast enough. I feel like such a fuck up. I gotta be at work in 30, so it'd be nice to know what to expect.
TL;DR:
