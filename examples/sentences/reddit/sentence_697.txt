TITLE: Me [20 M] with my GF [19 F] of 3 years, I need help seeing if I am in the wrong.
POST: My GF and I have been dating for a while now, since high school. We currently go to two different colleges, but spend nearly everyday together as happy as we can be during our breaks. 

Recently, she went to a leader ship camp recommend to her by a faulty member at her university. I am typically very introverted and only can bare having a few friends. Every one else mostly annoys me in some way, but I dont like to show it. So, of course at this camp they require people to become very close and develop freiend ships with eachother. She says she had an amazing experience and an overall good time.

My issue is that she obivously became good friends with both guys and girls. I don't care if she hangs out with all of them at once, it does bother me alittle when she hangs out with all of them at once, but it really bothers me when she hangs out with a guy one on one. 

To me, it means that there is a chance she will develop feeling for him or vice versa. I wouldn't mind if she was hanging out with him and i was with her all the time, but the amount of physical distance between us cause me to worry a fair amount. 

I feel as though i may be replaced, which causes me a lot of jealousy and stress. I have told her that I don't want her to hang out with other guys one on one. I know that is wrong, but I still cant help myself from feeling that way. Earlier today she basically told me, "too bad, I can have friends that are guys." Which is true, I just still don't like the idea. 

She has never done anything for me to lose trust in her, I am just not a very trusting person.

So, is it wrong for me to ask her to not hang out with other guys? Can anyone maybe help me think of a comprimise? Or just give some of your advice.

Thanks.
