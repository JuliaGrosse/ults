SUBREDDIT: r/tifu
TITLE: TIFU but telling my brother he is the Illuminati
POST: This happened like a week ago, I was playing in the computer and suddenly my brother approaches, I get mad when he is near me when I'm playing or reading things here on Reddit, so I told him to leave, he refused so I told him he is the Illuminati and he started crying and said "Mom, he said Im the loominady!!!!111!!" I lost. I culdn't stop laughing and she got mad but then since that day every triangle he sees he says "loominady cumfirmd" even in a public place, in school, in the street, in every place, and the worst part is everyone laughs, yeah, everyone laughs because someone says "illuminati confirmed"
TL;DR:
