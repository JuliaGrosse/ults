SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Girlfriend aka wifey (31F) and I (23M) has been in a 11 month relationship. She has lied, cheated, and keeps stealing from me. I feel so hurt today. Please help a fellow redditor as I'm not sure what to do with this relationship :'(
POST: I'm hurting so bad right now and am very disappointed at Lauren. Today she stole some of my prescription (again) today. As far as we have been in this relationship, she is very opportunistic when she steals from me e.g.  Money, my prescription medications, etc. At this point, I have to hide most of my valuables from her. 

From the cheating standpoint; Lauren has slept with her ex, RJ, early on in our relationship. RJ and Lauren have been dating for 12 years with an 11 year old daughter, Annie. Thing is, she doesn't generally like women and prefers having guys as friends. Also she keeps in touch with former flings post break up. I always find out or "catch her" after the fact as she isn't forthcoming to me. She expresses remorse to me long after an argument breaks out from this. This includes flirt text through FB, phone, pics sent, etc. 
What hurts me is that she tries to cover up/lie her way out of it or somehow turns it around to me. 

I haven't given anything less than the best of me, all of me, in this relationship. I support her and her daughter and have sacrificed alot to keep/maintain this relationship. I'm not saying I'm perfect or a saint either. I harbor these trust issues inside of me because of her past actions. However, I can proudly say I never have done anything remotely close to what she has done to me. In a way, I see myself healing her heart from her past and always push her to do the right thing and be the best she can be. 

Two question(s) that concerns me:

1) How should I approach her with the stealing situation? 

2) Is this relationship too toxic to even save?
TL;DR:
