TITLE: My [26M] child's mother [24F] won't respond to my request/demand for public visits only
POST: [OP](

After all the advice I got from you all and my attorneys office I emailed the ex to state that I would require public visits until we have an independent supervisor in place mutually or appointed by the court. 

I sent the first email Thursday night, with a follow up this morning, and just made a call to her mobile which ended in voicemail. 

If she fails to respond what should I do?

Her expectation is that the visit tomorrow will be at her house. But obviously I am uncomfortable with that considering she called the police on me at my own home for a "perceived" threat which the police apparently found baseless since they didn't make a report and left.
TL;DR:
