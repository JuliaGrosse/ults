TITLE: My girlfriend of 6 months (20F) is having a hard time thinking she's not good enough for me (21M) (in reality I'm nothing special, she's the special one)
POST: Sorry if I'm a little absent minded or write things that make no sense.

Basically, my girlfriend has slept with a lot of men and she regrets it all, we met six months ago and instantly clicked, she was trying to shove me away at the beginning because she thinks she is dirty and used. I told her that I loved her all the same. 

Regardless it's been a constant thing in our relationship, always hanging in the air. She just repeats how amazing I am and how lucky she is to have me all the time(I'm completely average, not that good looking not that special I have nothing amazing).

Today she just broke down saying she doesn't find herself "worthy" of me and that she feels like she's hurting me and that I deserve better. 

No matter what I tell her she won't change her mind, I managed to convince her to cool down and wait until tommorow but I'm worried since she's very emotional and attached she will disappear from my life.

Please, help me Reddit. I love her so much.
