SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [22 M] with my Ex Gf [20 M/F] and girl I met abroad [21 F], 3+ years relationship, broke up with GF abroad and now realized I messed up.
POST: So My GF and I of 3 years were both studying abroad at the same time in different locations. We had a really good relationship but for the past year she had not been putting in same amount of effort and things had become stale (sex life, gifts, etc). I go abroad and start to realize that I was putting in much more. There was another girl on the trip who had a bf of multiple years and I flocked towards here because of my flirtatious personality I thought it would be the safest bet. She fell for me and dumped her bf and I was infatuated with being wanted that feelings started to arise for me as well. I had planned on seeing my gf 4 weeks into the program and the night before I go she tells me she likes me and is dumping her bf. I go see my gf feel really guilty get blacked out drunk and then we fight and break up. Get back to where I was studying and start hooking up (no sex) with the other girl for about a week until I realized I fucked up. I started being distant until she called me out and said she just wanted to have fun for last 2 weeks and no strings attached. I planned on coming back home and being single for a while cause I never have been before. After coming back the other girl has been very adamant that she does not want the study abroad thing to end and I saw my ex and all the feelings came back and I realized it was the fantasy bubble of abroad that made me feel all of these things. She said she was pretty much over it and just needed time but still loved me, now all her friends are telling her I cheated (i didnt) and she freaked out on me. What do i do?
TL;DR:
