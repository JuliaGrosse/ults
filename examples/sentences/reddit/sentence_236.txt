SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [21 F] feel like i dont deserve my boyfriend [21 M] of 4 months. I am a nymphomaniac with depression and anxiety.
POST: I have never cheated on my boyfriend and never would (for the people who judge nymphos). My SO has depression and anxiety as well and recently hes been having break downs. But i dont know how to deal with this because im not well myself. I love him so much and feel so guilty when i imagine myself free and single as a nymphomaniac. Its not because im not happy with him its because im struggling to be well in regards to depression and it sets off my feelings of self loathing. Has anyone got any tips on how they help thier depression in relationships?
TL;DR:
