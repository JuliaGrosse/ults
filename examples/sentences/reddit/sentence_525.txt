TITLE: Me [30 M] with my [28 F] GF of 2.5 years. Debating on buying her a nice piece of jewelry (but not going to propose any time soon). Should I?
POST: What are the unwritten "rules" of buying a girlfriend jewelry well before you plan on proposing to her?

In our 2.5 years and counting of being in a committed relationship, I love her and would one day like to marry her. I've even told her this much, but there are a lot of factors in both of our lives that would not make this the right time to move forward with that, likely at least for another year and a half (work + finishing grad school + temporary relocation issues). Money is somewhat tight, but I recently do have some extra cash I can comfortably spend.

And though there are certainly things I would like to save for and buy for myself (new camera / lenses), part of me feels like I should buy something nice for her like a non-engagement ring, bracelet, earrings, or necklace. Something to make her feel like the special person she is to me. We have gone on vacations before, I take her out often, and I buy her nice gifts for all the holidays, but I have never really purchased any jewelry for her because she has seemed to have a lot from relatives of hers who passed away.

I feel like maybe I should have bought her something already at this stage in the relationship, and that just because she has never asked for it or demanded (not her personality to do so) doesn't mean that it has never crossed her mind or that she hasn't wished for something.
Anyone have any insight into this? I know it must sound so trivial, and I apologize for thatâ€¦ neither or us are materialistic at all, so that's ironically one of the sources of my stress with this matter.

THANKS!
