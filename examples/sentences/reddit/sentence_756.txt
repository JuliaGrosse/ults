TITLE: Shoplifted sushi from my school today. Got caught and embarrassed in front of my old crush.
POST: I'll admit this was pretty idiotic of me. 
I still cannot, for the life of me, understand why I did it. I was in the school store and two of my friends were with me there. My first friend walks in grabs a pack of sushi and slyly leaves. My second and best friend takes one, puts it under his shirt and leaves. Now I'm not a thief, I ain't about that life... But I saw my friends walk outta there with expensive sushi for free and I was like "...shit man I want some free sushi too". But here's where I made a boneheaded mistake. 

I grabbed the sushi and just walked out without thinking. What i didn't realize was that the lady at the counter was just glaring at me on the way out. As a matter of fact, THE ENTIRE LINE OF STUDENTS WERE JUST STARING AT ME. Now normally, I just wouldn't care about any of those strangers who didn't know me, but then I realized the girl I used to have a crush on, and was actually pretty interested me, was standing right in front of me and looking back, I realized she must have just been staring too. **cringe**
Of course I get my ass busted and embarrassed. I went back and no one forced me to, but I paid for the sushi. The lady was generous enough to not get me in any serious trouble, since she knows how embarrassing this was.  My friends saw me get in trouble, and were laughing their ass off. Apparently I stole that sushi in the most obvious way and attracted way too much attention. 

Someone threw out my sushi before I could even eat it too.
TL;DR:
