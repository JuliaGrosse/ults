TITLE: I'm afraid of becoming involved with someone again. Personal issue
POST: I'm a 25 year old male. For the last 4 years I've been afraid of getting involved with women.

It startes after I fell head over heals for a girl in college, for four years at school I was crazy about her but it was never returned.
After we left school she seemed to be more interested in me than before, we started to see each other often after work and eventually became physical, we never had sex but there was intense forplay most times I saw her.

This lasted for about 4 months, just fooling around nothing to serious. I decided I wanted to take it further and become more involved with each other. She came over and we started to talk, I let her know I care about her a lot and she said the same, when I asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend for real she said "I don't know".

Now at the time I was crazy about her, when I asked what she means by "I don't know" she just repeated it. I asked if she wanted to keep doing what we were doing and it was the same answer. After talking more it became clear we were not on the same level, I broke it off and she went home.

I had a period of deep depression for a while afterwards, it hurt to not be loved back but I got through it eventually. Since then I've had one summer fling, nothing serious just a few weeks but since that I've been afraid of getting involved again.

Is there anyone that might be able to relate to this and can offer some words to help?
