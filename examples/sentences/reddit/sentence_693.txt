SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: BF doesn't want to "change" me but doesn't like that I am shy?
POST: Background: I am 23 and very "inexperienced." I was very sheltered in Catholic schools going up, and never really experimented or dated. That being said, I can count all of my encounters with men besides my current bf on one hand. 

Fast forward to problem: I have been with my current bf for awhile, and honestly we are complete opposites, which is one thing that I love about him. I am reserved and shy while he is outgoing and knows everyone. Our personalities don't really mesh in the bedroom. I don't really initiate anything. I give it up every time he wants some, anywhere he wants some any way he wants some, but he asked me the other day why I don't initiate anything. It's just not my personality. Now he has gotten into asking if I would do things to him in advance of me hanging out with him which I think is wrong. Should I tell him to just stop whining?
TL;DR:
