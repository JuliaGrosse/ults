TITLE: Private school kids of Reddit, did you have any false preconceptions of public school kids? Likewise, did any public school kids have false preconceptions of private school kids?
POST: I went to a Christian private school for my entire life, but there were two public schools close by. We also played against those public schools in sporting events. We were always told to stay away from the kids in public schools, and were never encouraged to interact with these students during sporting events. 

This conditioned me into thinking that I was better than them, and that I was smarter for attending a private school. 

Once I got to a public university, it rocked my world that most public school kids were actually smarter than me, and they were more worldly as well. I found that being at a private school actually fucked me in a variety of ways. 

Part of me assumes that some public school kids may feel the same way. They may have been conditioned to hate private school kids in their area for stupid reasons, or they may have had a legitimate reason.
TL;DR:
