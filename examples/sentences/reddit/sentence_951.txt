TITLE: Me [40 M] with my lover [32 F] 1 month, slept with best friend (married) in the recent past
POST: Met this girl at a married friends family function. my friend is almost family, I dated his sister for 15 yrs which just fell apart, we haven't been together for 2 years. So i meet this new girl 32F last month. We hook up and the sex is AMAZING. Nothing is off the table. 32F works indirectly with my buddy. He has been married for 4 yrs and has a daughter and step daughter.

She tells me a  "secret" that she had sexual relations with my married friend. I am in complete shock. Now I have to face her, My friend, his wife and my EX? She is a hot mess. smoking, drinking, you name it. She also told me that she cheated on her ex fianc√©. Im seeing a pattern of self destruction. 

My concern is my friend and his wife, my ex and family. How can I proceed to visit them knowing this secret? I usually visit once a week and hang out for dinner. I don't think that I can face any of them. I know its not my fault or responsibility but I don't think that I can handle it. 

Plus now I am obsessed with trying not to think about her 32F screwing my married friend. The sex is so good, ANYTHING GOES, our sexual appetites are voracious. I know nothing good will come of it. I already don't trust her.

Should I stay away from everyone involved? I am devastated. I thought about telling my ex, but i don't want to be the guy who screwed a home wrecker, spilled the beans and ruined a marriage with children and was screwing a "slut".
