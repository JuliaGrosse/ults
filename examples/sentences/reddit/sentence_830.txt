TITLE: Need some advice on a possible adoption.. (x-post /r/dogs)
POST: Hey there! In about a month my parents and I might be taking in one of our neighbors dogs (A German Shepherd). As long as I've known them they've kept him confined to a cage (inside) 24/7, besides taking him for walks. They say they do this because he's very territorial and marks everything. I don't know if they're telling the truth, but what's the best way to end this habit if he continues it in his new home? Also, we have 4 cats. My mom and I love them dearly, and my mom is worried that they'll run away if we bring the dog in. Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
TL;DR:
