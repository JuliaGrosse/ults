TITLE: My(21m) girlfriend(24f) says due to her religious beliefs she no longer wants to have sex until marriage.
POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. We don't really see each other often because we both work a lot and our schedules conflict quite a bit. We aren't able to be alone all of the time. so through the entire span of our relationship we've had sex probably 10 times...

It has been like this since the beginning so I got pretty used to it and didn't really complain, however; she went on vacation for a couple of weeks to visit her family back home. She got back yesterday and we were talking about the trip and all that she did.

She told me that she went to church with her family and that she is now having second thoughts about us having sex and not being married. (She is catholic by the way) I was a little thrown off by the whole thing because obviously I disagree and it pretty much came out of nowhere so I don't like the idea. She said that she hasn't made up her mind about it she just feels guilty about it often. She also said she still believes that when the opportunity presents itself it will probably end up happening anyways.

I am not really sure how to approach this situation. I don't see an issue with us continuing to do what we do but she does and I don't want to pressure her or make her uncomfortable. I am absolutely fine with being in a relationship with her and not having sex if it's what she really wants but this whole thing is making me wonder if there is a deeper meaning to it all. How do I approach this situation. Should I just respect her wishes and patiently wait for years until she is ready again? Or should I just move on?
TL;DR:
