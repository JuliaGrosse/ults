TITLE: More of a favor than a question...
POST: My house was broken into a couple months ago (check my previous posts for proof) and one of the items that was stolen was the portal of power for my sons Skylanders game.  We have the game still along with all of the action figures....just no portal.  Apparently you cannot purchase the portal by itself anywhere.  I have checked at Best Buy, Gamestop, internet, etc. and nobody has one.  We don't want to purchase the full set again for stuff that we already have.  You can't resell it because then you still have the issue of whoever buys it doesnt have the portal.  Everyone keeps saying go to Ebay.  Ebay has some but nobody can confirm that they are in working order or want to charge an arm and a leg for one.  I don't mind paying for one, but I would like a fair price.  I'm just curious if any of you guys might have one laying around that you don't use any more and would sell for a reasonable price?  Any takers?
TL;DR:
