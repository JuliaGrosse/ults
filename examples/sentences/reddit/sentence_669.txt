TITLE: I [16m] need advice on how to help my gf [16f] feel her self worth.
POST: We meet at a camp during the summer. She wouldn't talk, look or even walk toward people because that's how bad of an introvert she was. Being an ex introvert I decided that I would try and help her come out of her shell.

I then realized that I really do have feelings for her like I actually liked her. I asked her out and she said yes. We have been together for a month now.

The problem started toward the 3 week mark of our relationship. She always says that other girls are so much prettier then her and she doesn't know why I'm with her and not these other girls because they're so much better then her.

What do I do to help her feel her self worth?
