SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: I am a geographically displaced intellectual in a world of meat-heads.  How do I make friends here?
POST: Long story short, i'm in the military and have been for 5 years now.  I still keep close contact with my friends back home, but since coming into the military i have made 0 friends.  

Why?  It isn't because i'm anti-social or anything like that.  It is because, in general, all the people i meet are of a much lower intelligence.  I either alienate them with my thought process or, more often, I can stand to have a conversation with them.

Is there some hobby i can pick up or some place i can go to interact with people more my speed?  Reddit, in general, has been a nice distraction within a community of (sometimes) like minded people.  

I laughed for hours on end at the physics joke thread; not one person at my work got any of the jokes.
TL;DR:
