TITLE: I'm [F23] feeling guilty about crushing on someone new [M25], 3 months after a break up. Is this justified?
POST: My ex and I had issues long before we broke up. He still had an ex in the picture, lied about doing drugs and various other things. Anyway, we broke up and he was my first serious bf (first sexual partner too). We weren't together for that long, 8 months two of which were long distance.

So I've met someone and despite the circumstances (he's one of my roommates. I know, I'm not going to act on it) and we get along really well. I'm kinda salty still and we joke about it. Usually we just chat and hang out, nothing serious. We consistently chat till late at night about all kinds of things. He often tells me to not feel like I need to rush getting out there. Until quiet recently something changed I started feeling mushy around him. Usually we joke and tease each other but suddenly it's stopped. He doesn't contact me during the day as often and when we do talk there are long pauses. 

I feel guilty for liking someone so soon, is it too soon? I don't want to get hurt or be used. I don't think I can be in a relationship right now but I think it makes me weird with the new guy. I know he likes me in some way but I feel like I've ruin something or turned him off with my mixed signals/push and pull behaviour.
TL;DR:
