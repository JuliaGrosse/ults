TITLE: I (18M) want to ask out a girl (18F) whom I haven't had contact with in 4 years
POST: So I had this huge crush on this girl during my years in middle-school (Gr. 6-Gr.8) and I'm certain she felt the same, but we were both too nervous to do anything about it. When high-school started we both went to different schools and never had any contact since. I tried to forget about her, but I couldn't and it has caused me to not want to ask any other girl out. After meeting an old friend from middle-school, who went to the same high-school as she did, I came to learn that she attends a university near mine. This friend has rekindled a flame, but I have no clue how to ask her out, let alone approach her. How do I go about doing so? Is it even possible? I should also mention I have her as a friend on FB and the fact that she's also single.
TL;DR:
