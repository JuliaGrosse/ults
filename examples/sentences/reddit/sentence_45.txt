TITLE: Me [19 M] with my GF [19 F] broke up after almost 3 years, hard time staying friends
POST: We broke up for college last year and I know I had a rough time, going from constantly seeing a best friend to not even communicating. It was an understandably mutual decision as we were both going forward in life, but it still hurt a lot.

Anyways after a few months of college, I thought I was done with her. Then she began drunk texting me quite often. I was civil at first then ignored them as I realized it was just hurting me and going nowhere. So I got over her again.

Now that we're back for summer, she's been wanting to hang out with mutual friends as we were all close. I thought I was at peace and had gotten over her but just seeing her again ruined my day. I felt (and still feel) like I'm going through the breakup all over again. 

Avoiding her is out of the question since my best friends are close friends of hers as well. We were all one big happy family and now there's this awkward rift between my ex and I that is stemming from my confused feelings and was damn near palpable to my friends when we all got together today.

Also, I would never want to leave my friends, especially because of her.
