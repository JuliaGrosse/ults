TITLE: Watch out for nails!
POST: I've been reading this subreddit for a while, and yesterday, I finally had a moment worthy of submission.

I was walking from my apartment to a convenience store down the street, and as I crossed the intersecting road to exit the complex (legally, mind; I had the signal to walk), a pretty boy in a loud, expensive sedan (BMV, CMW, something like that) pulls up at the light, and seeing me to his right, honks immediately, in outrage that I would have the utter nerve to block his right-on-red.

It startled me, so I looked back, and then I noticed a single nail perfectly poised in the apex of his turn, point up and everything. It was a big, gnarly construction nail too, which isn't a surprise given the work being done around here.

His windows were down. I could have said something. But then he honked again, so I turned back and kept walking. When I heard his fancy imported tires squeal past, I glanced toward his passing car. Sure enough, the nail was jutting out of the sidewall of the facing rear tire.
