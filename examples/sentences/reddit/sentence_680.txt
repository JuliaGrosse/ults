TITLE: What were the little changes you made when starting your journey that got you results in the long run?
POST: Giving up sugar/carbs? Walking 20 minutes a day? Drinking more water? Finding a more consistent sleep schedule?

I recently moved away from my hometown for the first time in my life (32 years). I was living a lifestyle I never thought I'd fall in to: drinking, smoking, late-night fast food, very sedentary. Now that I've removed myself from that environment, I'm finding I'm craving a healthier lifestyle. I've been trying the keto diet as the friend I'm living with has been doing it for a few months and has had great success. I also don't have a car, so it's either cycling or walking for me if I want to get out of the house. I also quit smoking 5 days ago, cold turkey. That's been the hardest bit, but yesterday I went for a 12+ mile hike and I realized quickly how important it is that I stick with it!

I want to do more to start this journey, but I know myself. I'm a former 4-sport and college athlete, and I get very competitive, especially with myself. I can be very black and white ("You either go to the gym 7 days a week, or don't go at all."), which can lead to me getting burnt out very quickly. I don't want that. I want to show myself that I don't need to be miserable and all-or-nothing in order to achieve this goal. 

Anyway, I've seen a few posts where people have shared their successes and they often start with, "It began by giving up soda" or "I started taking the stairs instead of the elevator at work". I'm just curious to know what got you started and what kept you going without wearing you out. 

I'm open to ANY feedback. Thanks!
