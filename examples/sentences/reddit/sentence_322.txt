TITLE: My [25F] boyfriend [28M] doesn't like birthdays.
POST: My boyfriend of a year doesn't like birthdays, especially birthday parties. He loves parties but doesn't like them when he is the center of attention. He doesn't like photos where he's the center of attention. When we first started dating, he refused to even tell me when his birthday was until I finally prodded it out of him.

I come from a background where birthdays were the one time in my life where I got what I wanted. I had a party, got to eat the food I liked, and even got presents that I actually wanted. It was such a rarity that I always get excited on my birthday. My boyfriend loves contributing to my birthday, and has contributed to cooking me the food and cake that I like and attending my parties with me. He even showers me with gifts.

His birthday is a bit away. Last year I made him this ice cream cake that he wanted and got him a small present that he opened in private. I also had his friends over while they were unaware it was his birthday to have a small dinner get-together, and he seemed content with that. Eventually, however, they discovered it was his birthday when his mom posted on facebook so it became a birthday party and he got really uncomfortable.

I don't want to steamroll him into having a birthday, but I'm also worried that by not acknowledging it at all I'm not showing my appreciation for him. He's the best boyfriend I have ever had, so I don't want to fuck it up. What should I do?
TL;DR:
