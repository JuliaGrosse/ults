TITLE: I [19M] am conflicted on dating a girl I like [16F].
POST: I've been friends with a girl for the last four months or so. Throughout those months, we hung out a few times, have gone on a couple of dates, and kissed once. That being said, we have never had more than the label of "friends", and with the exception of last-night I haven't hung-out with her for 3 months. I invited her to a New Years Eve party, which she eagerly accepted. We ended up talking through the entire night, and ended it with a kiss. We parted ways after midnight because my group had plans to head off to the bar. Where I live, 16 is the age of consent.

Morally, I'm conflicted on what to do. I feel terrible for leading this girl on for the last few months, and I'm well-aware of the fact that she has feelings for me. I think she's an awesome person. Attractive, funny, intelligent, and mature. I'm just incredibly hung up on the age difference. When I graduate college as a nurse, she'll just be graduating high-school (she is currently in grade 11). While I feel we're compatible, I think we may be at different stages in life. How can I gently gauge the situation without leading her on? I'm debating on inviting her out with some friends and I tomorrow night (they all love her) and seeing how it goes, but I really don't want to give her false hope because I'm simply not sure yet.
TL;DR:
