TITLE: Can someone explain Lemon Law to me (X-Post from /r/Motorcycles)
POST: Unfortunately I'm a Georgia resident and our lawmakers decided lemon law statues shouldn't apply to motorcycle consumers. In July '13 I purchased a new Triumph Daytona 675 ABS model and have continually been bent over by constant issues.

It was first in the shop within a month of purchase for an oil leak. Shortly after (hours/days I forget, but theres paperwork proving) it had to be taken back in because dipshit forgot a crush washer and it was still leaking.

Cool, my bike is fixed! Just kidding, coolant leak. This happens about 1-2 months after the initial oil problem. It spends roughly several weeks in the shop over the course of two attempts, and the problem doesn't get fixed properly by them. I give it a crack myself, lo and behold the hose clamp just needed tightened. FUCK YOU.

Well here comes another issue. The bitch just decided to turn off mid ride and throw a check engine light & oil light. There's no need to add any oil, doing so would just overfill it from where it's at. The bike actually doesn't use much oil at all (aside from when it fucking leaked months prior).

This is going to be it's like uh.. 5th visit or so to the dealer for issues in 8 months. It's already spent somewhere near 2 months in the shop, and going off past experiences it's probably going to spend another 2-3 now, if not longer because riding season is up and going in Georgia.

My issue is, again, that I am not protected by any state lemon laws. How far does the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act go? Will a lawyer be able to push for a full refund or compensation with a new machine, or is that entirely off the table due to fucktarded state laws? It's complete bullshit that a bike has to spend 3 months in the shop out of what will be 9 months of ownership by the time that I get it back from the shop.
TL;DR:
