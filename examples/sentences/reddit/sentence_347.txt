TITLE: Heartache, lost and confused
POST: I [21] saw my ex-girlfriend/best friend [21] of almost three years yesterday. This was the first time I've seen her in about eight months (we live on opposite ends of the state). Now this is a girl that I never got over and am still completely in love with. We dated for about five months and then I broke up with her because I was scared of falling in love and was to selfish to admit just how much I cared about her. 
Time passed and I realized just how fucking much she means to me. I tried to forget about her by sleeping around, dating other girls,and just doing everything in my power to push her out of my mind. I saw her this past weekend because she came down for a mutual friends wedding (which we went to together) and realized that I am completely lost without her and can't imagine her not being in my life. 
She has a boyfriend at the moment, and if that wasn't hard enough, he doesn't treat her with respect or the love she deserves (and I know that I could treat her so much better.) Anyway, we had a long talk about it this weekend, and apparently she still loves me just as much as I love her, but we both suck at long distance relationships and she wants to see if things eventually work out between herself and this guy; but she admitted that if they don't, she isn't gonna try dating anyone else and will just wait till we can be together. 
She left this morning and I have been a complete wreck ever since. I just miss her so damn much and am so scared of losing her. I feel so lost and don't know what to do anymore. How do I get through this?
TL;DR:
