TITLE: My wife said I should have dug through a bin of wet gym towels to find my Speedo that I mistakenly tossed in there
POST: So, at the gym today in the men's locker room, I had my Speedo wrapped in a towel to dry when I tossed in the very large bin of used towels. 2 minutes later i realized what i did, but by that time at least 5 other guys had thrown their towels into the bin... and the bin was already about half full. There was no way that I was going to go digging through dozens of wet or sweaty towels that have been on the floor, on random genitals, and on strange ass bits.

So I told my wife this story expecting a laugh and she looked at me incredulously because I DIDN'T go digging through the nasty heap towels. Then she started talking down to me like I was an paranoid germaphobe who was being completely unreasonable. Whaaaa?

I told her that you could get fungus, warts, staph and a whole strain of other infections from this sort thing and she just told me that I should wash my hands afterwards.

Am I wrong? Should I have dug through a bin of used gym towels to find my stupid swimsuit?
TL;DR:
