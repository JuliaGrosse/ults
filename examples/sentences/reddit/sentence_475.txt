SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Girlfriend of 9 Months dumped me unexpectedly. (Need Help, please read and respond, sorry for the long story)
POST: So I have been dating a single mom (34 with a 4 year old boy) for nine  months (I'm 27).  Our relationship was so great, we did everything together and I was a big part of her and her families life.  Her son loved me, always asked about me, I taught him to skateboard and we got along so well.  We had a really great summer, I went on vacation with her family and they really liked me, her nephews (twin 7 year old boys) would tell me they loved me, life was going good.  So in October we went to Florida to visit her family, and spent 3 days in Disney World.  Her family really liked me but when we got to Disney there was a problem with the room (I thought it was paid for and didnt have enough on me to cover it).  So I ended up owing her 400$.  When we returned I started paying her back, 50$-100$ a week.  Well after we returned she started getting real distant from me, she was getting mad at me all the time over nothing and kept saying she was just a little sad and it was nothing to worry about.  Well last Friday without warning she dumped me, said that her Ex-Husband was dating a girl that basically replaced her.  Plays on her old softball team, is coaching her ex's other daughter (not my girls kid) in softball and is and I quote "living her life."  I'm really hurt by all this and kind of a mess.  I want her back but I'm worried that shes not over her old life.  What do I do???
TL;DR:
