SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [28M] and my wife [25F] are in a dry spell. Having trouble coping with my PG-rated marriage.
POST: We've been married 4.5 years so far. Both each other's first. I'm relatively normal as far as upbringing, struggle with mild depression at times. She has reproductive/hormonal medical issues, currently being treated, Also a history of childhood sexual abuse, but she's extraordinarily strong and has coped with this very well.

Last time we were intimate was in December 2013. Before that, October 2013. Before that, June or August 2013. Been gradually slowing down since we were married. Aside from the sex we're mostly fine, relationship-wise. She says it's likely due to her medication, and medical conditions. I can accept that. 

My problem is that it's starting to affect my well-being. I'm depressed and anxious often. I'm losing emotional connection and distancing myself. My advances are pathetic and hopeless, and just make her feel worse for saying no.

I often feel like she doesn't consider me attractive although she says she does.  It doesn't help that she's openly said she thinks "naked men are gross" (meaning to me she doesn't like penises, which I can also understand considering her history). I have let her know this hurts me, and she hasn't mentioned it again, but I keep thinking "honey, how would you feel if I said 'breasts are disgusting!' Except yours, yours are great." It's playing on my mind a lot lately.

I need some advice on getting through this. I don't want to be driven by my sexual needs. Masturbating/porn doesn't help, it just makes me crave the real thing more and I personally think it's disgusting and selfish. I don't know if I want advice or commiseration here, but it's to the point I'm considering looking into some kind of drug to "neuter" my sex drive for the time being.
TL;DR:
