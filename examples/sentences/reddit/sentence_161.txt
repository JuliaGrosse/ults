TITLE: Me [22 F] with my BF [21 M] one year open relationship, slept with someone else, not sure if I have feelings for him anymore.
POST: I go away to school in another country. I come home in May for the summer. Last May, my current BF asked me out (we have known each other for 5 years and have been close friends). I had a crush on him forever so naturally I did say yes.

At the end of the summer I had to go back to school for my final year. We both decided that our relationship was too young to do long distance. We decided to have an open relationship so we would not have to worry about each other cheating. When I am home for breaks we are completely monogamous, and when I graduate and come home we are going to return to monogamy.

I went the whole school year with not doing anything with anyone else. However, 2 nights ago I slept with someone I have been flirting with for a while. I did not mean to sleep with him but alcohol was involved, and I am incredibly attracted to this other guy. 

This would not be a problem, accept for whatever reason sleeping with someone else made me less interested in my BF. Now I feel annoyed whenever he texts me, whereas before I felt I was in love and I could not weight to come home and be with him. 

Is this natural? When I go home to my BF and we resume a monogamous relationship will I get my feelings back? I am worried about how much I enjoyed being with someone else. I feel like a bad person, and I learned a side of myself that I did not know existed.
TL;DR:
