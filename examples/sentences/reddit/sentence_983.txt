TITLE: My (19F) friend (19F) played a cruel 'prank' on me and someone else
POST: My friend Bethany (not actual name) was texting an acquaintance of ours. I see him frequently around the college campus and we occasionally talk but that's the extent of our interactions. 

Anyway, she told me that he confessed that he likes me. I didn't know this so it was a surprise. She then told me that she thought it was funny to say that I coincidentally had a "surprise date" planned for Friday night. That's a lie. I don't have feelings for him and didn't plan anything. 

She told me he was excited and asked her lots of questions. This isn't even my fault and I feel so awful! I got pissed at her for putting me in this situation. She said that it's just a harmless prank and that he's stupid for believing her. She gave him my number and he's been texting me ever since. 

What the hell do I do? How can I tell him that I have NOTHING planned for Friday and my friend just pranked him? I am seriously contemplating whether I should play along and actually go on a date with him. I just feel so bad for him :(
TL;DR:
