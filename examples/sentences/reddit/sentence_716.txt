TITLE: I'm [29 M] struggling to support my girlfriend [23 F]
POST: I'm worried this is going to make me sound awful but I'm really struggling to cope. My girlfriend and I moved in together a few weeks ago and this coincided with her Grandpa getting very sick.

As a result she's been visiting him at his care home or her grandma virtually every night after work.

This effectively means I'm doing all the chores and cooking dinner because by the time she gets home it's too late for her to do it. Then when she does get back she's upset and needs cheering up.

I'm trying to be supportive but it's wearing me out. This morning she told me not to clean the kitchen before she gets back and that she'd cook dinner but then her mum rang her and asked her to go and see her grandma after work because she's upset.

I'm not going to leave the messy kitchen and the dinner for her but I'm exhausted and I'm pissed off that the rest of her family are taking so little responsibility.

She's got a sister who works in our town who could visit her grandparents after work but doesn't and two cousins who also do nothing.

On top of this I have an elderly Grandpa of my own who I'm struggling to visit because of the added burdens being placed on me.

I'm quite stressed at work at the moment and I can't deal with the thought of going home, cleaning the kitchen, cooking the dinner and putting laundry on then cheering my girlfriend up when she inevitably comes back in tears.

I want her to stop carrying her family on her back because the longer this goes on the more the others are going to just assume it's fine and they don't need to help out.

Any advice?
