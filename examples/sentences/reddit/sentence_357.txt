SUBREDDIT: r/weddingplanning
TITLE: Is going to David's Bridal *JUST* to look a terrible idea?
POST: So, my wonderful /r/weddingplanning people (my new family, now that I'm engaged...ahhhh!), I need some advice. 

As I stated, I am newly engaged, as of yesterday. We aren't planning on getting married until 2016, so I have plenty of time to plan. However, we've been discussing our plans for our wedding for quite awhile, so I already know basically what I want on most levels, and just need to find the realistic options. 

This includes my dress. I know the exact style I want, the fabric, and the color, the choice will just come down to how much detail is on the dress itself. 

I don't plan on going dress shopping seriously for about a year, but I am going down to visit my mom in a few weeks, and she wants to go dress "looking" with me while I'm there. 

I already told her if we go I don't want to go for very long, because my fiance will be at home with me, and I don't want to leave him alone with no one to hang out with for forever. 

SO! My idea is to go to David's Bridal with my mom for an hour or two. I don't plan on buying from them, because of all the horror stories I've heard, and I figure they have enough of a selection that I can show her the basic style I'm looking for. 

Is this idea idiotic? Am I going to randomly fall in love with a dress from a store I never want to give money too just because I'm emotional and with my mom and then freak out because I didn't want to buy it yet?
TL;DR:
