SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I think I am done dating my current GF. What are ways to know that this is the choice I want/how do it with the least pain.
POST: I am male 23 and she is a female 21. We have been dating for just under 2 years now, I am in my last semester of college and I feel as if I am just waiting for college to end to break up with her as opposed to doing it now. First off I really do love her, she has been there for me as a friend and as a girlfriend. I just dont see it progressing any further. So then I ask myself why wait and just do it already to let the healing start/having other opportunities to meet someone. 

We talked about it last night and she just said to give it a chance and that she thinks the relationship is salvageable. Personally I just think she doesn't what to loose me. 

All of that being said I do not want to crush this woman however I do not see any other way around it. No matter what she will be devastated.
TL;DR:
