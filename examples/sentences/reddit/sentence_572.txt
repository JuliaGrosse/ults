TITLE: How to ask for more time to decide on a job offer?
POST: Sorry about asking this again. I read like 20 threads and 20 articles about this issue, but a lot of them were either not really answered, a different situation, or some combination of the two. I know this question in the most repetitive questions thread.

To start off, the usual. Job A gave me an offer, I'd like to wait for Job B to offer. Job B still requires another interview at least.

The problem for me now is that Job B is much better than Job A. Job A is part time sales associate, Job B is full time in a different field I'd probably consider continuing. That makes Job B the "dream job", and I would definitely take it if offered.

Will a part time job even give me time to think about it? How do I ask them for that time without them just moving on with a different candidate. I also dont want to waste their time and mine by reneging.
TL;DR:
