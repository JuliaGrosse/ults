TITLE: TIFU by throwing my backpack at my mom's freind
POST: So my parents are divorced and my dad has to go to work early in the morning, so he brings me over to my mom's house in the morning at around 6:30, because she goes to work later in the day. It's complicated, but that's all you need to know.

Last night, I didn't go to sleep until around 2:00. So when my dad woke me up in the morning at 6:30 I was pissed and extremely tired. I wasn't really thinking straight.

When we finally arrived at my mom's house, I unlocked the door and went up into my room because I wanted to go back to sleep, since school doesn't start until 8:00. I walked into my room, and I instantly knew something was wrong. There was clothes all over the floor and a suitcase in the corner, but I didn't really think much of it because I was so tired.

I walked up to the bed and saw a human-shaped figure underneath the covers. At first, I thought It was my mom sleeping in my bed, but I dismissed that idea because I couldn't see her head. So I thought it must just be an odd arranging of the covers. I threw my backpack at the figure, just in case. I wasn't thinking straight. It was a stupid idea. When it hit the figure, I knew I had fucked up. A woman sprang upwards from the bed, and she stared me straight in the eyes, a true face of fear. She said, in a super scared voice, "Hey John (me), It's me, Wendy, you're moms friend. I'm sorry for sleeping in here, I didn't know you were coming over!" In my mind I was saying "FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!" I said, thinking quickly, "SORRY!" and slammed the door. The rest of the week staying with her was extremely awkward.
