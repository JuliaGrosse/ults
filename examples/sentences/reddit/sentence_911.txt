TITLE: I (23F) asked him (27M) out. Had a great time but he stopped responding. Help?
POST: Hello all. So here is the story:

I met this handsome fellow out at a bar and we ended up drunkenly making out by the end of the night. I got his number and we were texting the next few days. I asked him if he wanted to go out again and meet up. We met up and had a great date. It ended with a nice makeout but this time, not alcohol induced. 

He asked if I wanted to have dinner later that week and I said yes but we never made set plans. We text on and off for the rest of the week. He went on a business trip and texted me again when he came back the day before St. Patrick's Day. He was very very cute and even called me "babe". I asked him if he would want to hang out for St. Patrick's Day and he said he might be able to. I call him the next day and leave a voicemail asking if he would like to meet up and that I am heading to a block party. My phone's battery ran out soon after that. 

The next day I texted him asking how his weekend was celebrating and I have not received anything back since. It has been a week and a half. I am just wondering if perhaps I did something wrong. Lost interest? I came on too strong? Perhaps I don't understand men as much as I thought? ha. I am SO confused!
TL;DR:
