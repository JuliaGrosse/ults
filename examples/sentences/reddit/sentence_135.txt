TITLE: I [15 M] don't feel good enough for my [16F] amazing girlfriend
POST: I have been dating the most amazing person for 5 months (I know it's not at all long but it's my first relationship). Her name is Rachel and she is everything I could have asked for; she is absolutely gorgeous, intelligent, creative, and insanely kind-hearted. Her and I were friends for a year before we started dating. I feel like I'm not worth her time. Everything in my mind tells me that I'm not good enough.

She never gets to spend time with anyone because she is so busy. Every possible state test and final is coming up for her and she has been so stressed (She has had Star Testing, District Write, AP testing, random, 8-day testing for Juniors, AND finals will be coming up soon). I understand she has a lot on her plate and admire how much self-motivation she has, but I keep having to cage up my emotions because she isn't very fond of couples expressing physical relationships in public.

I am totally fine with her not liking public displays of affection, but it is starting to get to me because I never get to see her alone and express my feelings more. It wouldn't feel real if I did it over text; I would much rather do it in person because then I would have to come out of my shell a bit instead of hiding behind a phone.

Thinking about it, there are two points of contention. 

1.) Her and I never get to spend meaningful time together

2.) I have low self-worth

Being high school students, this will probably all get better over summer when we have time, but I have been really thinking about it recently and it's been stressing me out a lot. Is there anything I can do to lessen one, if not both of the points of contention? Jesus I hate my teenager hormones.
