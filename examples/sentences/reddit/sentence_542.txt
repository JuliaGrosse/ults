TITLE: Possibly in love with my best friend. Help?
POST: This wouldn't be so hard for me (22f) to handle, except I have to sit idly by and listen as he (22m) talks to our mutual friends about hooking up with other chicks and whether or not he would have a chance getting with any of them.

I feel extremely used when I think about him looking for other girls, despite understanding he says we have no chance... I've tried just cutting the sex out of our friendship and looking for another guy to catch my eye, bit I've fallen to hard... 

 I can't just say goodbye and be done with him because we've been really amazing friends far longer than I've had these feelings for him. And his friendship means more to me than my feelings for him

Background help:

In a "fuck buddy" relationship for about a year now.

He knows my feelings for him, ive told him flat out, and but tells me he can't allow himself to open up to another person because he can't stand another heart break.

What else is there to do?
TL;DR:
