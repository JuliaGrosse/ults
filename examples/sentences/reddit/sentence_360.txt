TITLE: Me [28 M] with my GF [28 F] of 3 months, she lives an hour away and I have conflicting feelings depending on whether I'm with her or not
POST: I posted on here a while back about making things official with a girl I'd been seeing. We ended up doing so, and it's been going alright. However, she lives about about an hour away from, so we only see each other ~3 days/week. I've noticed that I feel differently about her depending on whether I'm with her or not. When I'm not with her, I tend to focus on her negative attributes and ruminate about the things I don't like about her -- not only the things that bug and annoy me, but how much better it would be to be single again. However, when I'm with her, I tend to forget those things to some degree and I do enjoy her company. Has anyone else felt this way/Is this normal? If so, how do you manage? 

And might this be indicative of some kind of incompatibility?

I know the easy answer to this dilemma is to just 'hang out with her more,' but that's not really possible given my work and her schedule.
TL;DR:
