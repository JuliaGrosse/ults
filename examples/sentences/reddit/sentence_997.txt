TITLE: My dogs have totally lost their biscuits.
POST: So my family has two fairly large mixed breed dogs, M6 and F9. We've had both since puppies, so we know they werent abused, but my parents never formally trained them. They've never been good with visitors and now its gotten to the point where they completely run the house. My parents treat them like spoiled children. 

The female dog, who has always had fairly strong herding tendencies, has gone totally insane in the last few years. She growls, barks and gives warning bites to anyone who gets in her space (AKA the whole house.) I can't have friends over anymore because she has bit all of them for leaning the wrong way, entering a room without her permission. She's not allowed outside anywhere but our back yard because she bit/nipped (no blood) a kid in our neighborhood. Now she whines all day long for no apparent reason and nothing will make her shut up. 

The other male dog seems to have learned from her that these behaviors get her attention and is now imitating her with barks, growls and whines. My parents both feel that putting down the crazy dog is way over the line, and she is my pet so I'm not in support of that either, but shes lost her marbles and nothing seems to help. We've put her on mild meds that just make her sleep but don't solve the underlying problems. 

She's 9 years old, but what are we supposed to do, just let her be the queen bitch of the house and wait who knows how long until she passes? Would love some advice for dealing with such extreme dog behavioral issues, especially a fairly old dog. Thanks r/dogs!
