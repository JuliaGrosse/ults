TITLE: When was the last time you actually watched live television?
POST: I'm guessing that most people today have some form of DVR, whether it be a Tivo or the one you rent from your local television service provider.  I personally have a Ceton InfiniTV 4 card in my computer with 2 Switched Digital Video Tuning Adapters that provides for 4 HD streams at a time.  That along with a 2 TB Hard Drive makes for a pretty decent queue of recorded television shows for my fiance and I to watch when we feel like it.

Today I sat down on the couch and after flipping through the recorded TV queue decided I didn't really want to watch any of those things, so I hit the "Guide" button on my remote to see what was on.  It dawned on me that this was the first time in at least 2 months that I had watched live television, when I tried to skip forward past a commercial and realized that I couldn't lol.

So yeah, how about you?
TL;DR:
