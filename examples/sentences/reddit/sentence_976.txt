TITLE: Why do I [22F] not feel bad going through a breakup with my [25M] boyfriend?
POST: We were together for about 10 months - a healthy, happy, loving and caring relationship from start to finish - and he recently moved in with me. Ultimately the breakup wasn't very volatile: We want different things in different cities, and don't want to hurt one another by failing to live our truths and become the best people we can be... even though that means separating by thousands of miles, and not being together any more. 

Our conversations have been mature and honest, but while he is devastated -- alternately sleeping on the couch and sobbing in my arms -- I am... relieved? And maybe even a little excited, and actively holding myself back from contacting other people I had crushes on during the relationship, all before he's even figured out where he will go when he leaves my apartment. 

Obviously I've been checked out of the relationship for some time, and have already gone through lots of the grieving process prior to the actual breakup. But I feel like a sociopath for watching someone I loved, and will absolutely always love, be in so much pain while I have yet to even cry (and don't feel like I'm going to). What gives? Am I emotionally stunted, or is the grief only going to hit when he's actually gone, or something else?
TL;DR:
