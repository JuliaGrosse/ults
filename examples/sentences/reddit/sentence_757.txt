TITLE: 2 pairs of shoes or a new phone?
POST: Hi guys, so I've been saving up since Christmas and I now have $300 and, being a junior in highschool, I don't have bills to pay so I spend my money on more materialistic things. I'm a bit of a sneakerhead and I've been looking at these two pairs of shoes that I love that I can get with my money (keep in mind I already have about 13 pairs of shoes). Yesterday, however, I saw where I can pay $250 and trade in my phone and begin the $25 a month cycle again but with a new phone. Right now I have an S5 with a horribly broken camera and it has lost its waterproofing. I'm also a bit of a gadget fan so new phones are always on my mind. I could wait until January and get a new phone and not pay the $250 but I really want one now.
TL;DR:
