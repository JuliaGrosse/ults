TITLE: You Stuffed Me Up.. But I Think I'm Winning. Finally.
POST: You were the girl that made me something I never wanted to be...

You used me to pay, drive you, take you out & make you feel special but kept me at arms length, our mutual friends knew exactly what you were doing but never told me. 3 months until you said you need to focus on your studies and from there weeks until you had a Boyfriend..

4 months until it was all over and we met again at a party, not had spoken a word to each other.. I was still f@cked up with what happened as you were the girl that I actually fell in love with.

I let my heart give you another chance but it is still the biggest mistake of my life.

Fast forward 8 months of the same of keeping me at arm's length which I stupidly don't even know as I'm so blinded by my feelings for you.

You do it again you say you need to focus on yourself its not working... 

You left me AGAIN for someone else. 1 week. It killed me.

Depression hit me hard I didn't know if it was me or you.. 

I'm finally out of this 3 and half year runt.. I've kept girls at an arm's length and used them as you used me.. played with their emotions not giving two shits about them.. I've apologized as it's the right thing to do because I know I was wrong and given them the closure you never gave me.

Its now that its all over I know I've grown and become 100 times better person.. You made me something I never wanted to be but now its over.. your hold is on me is over... 

I've now happy, I don't need that closure. Because If it wasn't for my temporary insanity I wouldn't be working where I am and about to have a trip of a lifetime with some of my best friends!
