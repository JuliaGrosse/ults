TITLE: TIFU by smiling at a cute girl in the elevator
POST: I was walking into the elevator in my apartment building on the 7th floor, as I enter I see a cute girl so I smile as I walk in (as I smile when I see any cute girl) I turn to the right to press the lobby button and as I look to the right (my blind spot) I see her big ass buff boyfriend shit gets awkward as he stares me down, still I decide to stand next to her and between him because after all, it is an elevator how much space do you have. He then moves to go hold his girls hand and then looks at me like i'm crazy (LOL) I don't know if he thought I was hitting on his girl or something but that wasn't even the case (but she was cute) we're all just standing there as we descend 7 awkward floors before we get out and part ways. The most awkward part of this all is I see this guy while i'm doing my laundry, he lives one floor above me so I often see him in the elevator when he does so now every time I see him he'll probably remember me as the guy who tried to hit on his girl.
TL;DR:
