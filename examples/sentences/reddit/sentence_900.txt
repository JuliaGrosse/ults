TITLE: What to do with our LTR if one person moves out of the country? (22F/22M)
POST: We've been together for three years. My SO (22M) and I (22F) have been living together for the past two years. My lifelong dream has been to move to Japan and now I have the opportunity to do so -- I can go to grad school there. My SO on the other hand is completely disinterested in anything related to Japan, so there's absolutely no chance that he'd come with me. Neither of us have been in long distance relationships before and honestly I think it'd break our relationship, since our relationship has a strong physical component.
