TITLE: Boyfriend [20] of a couple months has no time for me [18 f] anymore
POST: I'll try to keep this as concise as possible, as relationship problems often involve anything and everything you've ever done together. But a little background, My boyfriend and I have been crushin' on each other pretty heavily throughout high school. Things started up for us near the beginning of the summer, some...unfortunate things happened, but we're back together for good now and really in love. 

Unfortunately, he also started a new job as a waiter and he works from the afternoon late into the night about five days a week (including everyday of this weekend :-( ). On top of that he is starting nursing school after not having gone to school for a year, which takes up the better part of every weekday. 

Obviously these are huge changes and take up tons of time for him, which causes a lot of stress. So not only does he really not have any time to spend with me (when he's not working or at school he's studying), but he is also very irritable these days. He really doesn't make me feel very loved. I don't think I'm very hard to please, but he doesn't even do any of the 'little things' that make people happy. In fact, he's almost always upset and closed off. But I am reasonably understanding about this because I know what immense pressure he's under. 

I offer all that I can to help him with this. I drive us everywhere, pay for most things, help him study, and am here for him to talk to whenever he needs it. I just don't know if I can take much more of this. I absolutely love the hell out of him but I have to force myself into his schedule, always to his reluctance, and sit around and watch him in complete overloaded misery. We don't go out anymore, we barely ever do any fun things, and to be honest it's just hard to be happy around him anymore. And it's going to be like this for the rest of the year
TL;DR:
