TITLE: TIFU by trying to hand shake a blind man who I obviously knew was blind.
POST: So this actually did just happen 10 minutes ago....
It's thanksgiving and I'm at my Brazilian grandmother's house. Every year we have a lot of my grandmother's friends and family come over to visit and eat delicious food my grandmother slaves over all day long. no one has showed up yet so I decided to snooze off on the couch. The doorbell rang and woke me up which was good because that means people are showing up which means food. So the first people were a nice foreign couple. A middle aged women and a man who was holding one of those sticks blind people have. Now the man is not %100 percent blind. He was really nice and sweet. I decided to introduce myself to him and out of habbit I held out my hand... oh god.. he's blind and there's no Turning back.. everybody sees me do this, All of the family. The middle age woman (his wife) took huge offense to this and thought I was playing a joke.. on her partially blind husband.. they left just a minute ago.. I fucked up reddit.. I fucked up.
TL;DR:
