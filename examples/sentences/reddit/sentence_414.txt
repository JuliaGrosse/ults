SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I (21 M) am not sure where I stand with this girl (27F)I've been smoking weed and sleeping (like literally just sleeping) with.
POST: I asked her out awhile ago and she said yes, I kinda got the vibe she didn't take me seriously because of the age difference, but the first time we hung out we smoked and drank, and slept in the same bed. The only mixed feelings I got from that was she slept and walked around half naked in front of me. But again because of the age difference, I didn't think much of it. We had plans to hang out a couple more times but she kept flaking and seemed a little distant so I decided to give up, take a hint and quit talking to her. 

After about a week of not talking I saw her Friday and she was flirty and touchy with me. She asked me to hang out and we did the same thing has the first time. When we were going to sleep she kept getting closer to me but I didn't make a move, well in the morning she initiated cuddling with me and kept shoving her ass into my boner. I had to leave and she asked what we were gonna do on our days off, and I said I'll let you know later. How should I proceed? I still don't know if she likes me because of the age difference and how she acted after we first hung out until I quit showing interest and then she started doing these things. Am I overthinking this all?
TL;DR:
