TITLE: I [35F] just found out my BF [23M] has been lying to me for 3 years about his virginity
POST: My BF and I have been together off and on for 3 years. Our relationship has been entirely long distance, due to various circumstances. When we first met online, we discussed our dating histories, and he made it seem like he was fairly experienced. He later told me he had only had sex with a couple of girls and had a blowjob from another. 

Now, three years later, I have finally bought a plane ticket and booked a hotel room to come see him this December, and last night he informed me that he has been lying to me all these years and he is actually a virgin. He has pecked one girl on the mouth, and that is the extent of his experience with women. 

I don't know what to do. The virginity itself isn't an issue, or at least it isn't much of one. But the lie is killing me. It's one he referred to and referenced and built on over and over all this time, embellishing and reinforcing it every time it came up. I have been sexual with him despite obviously never having physical sex with him, and I feel like I would have done things differently in that area if I had known. I feel stupid for never seeing through his lies, and angry at him for maintaining it so long. He wants to move forward as though nothing has changed, because for him nothing has. What do I do now?
TL;DR:
