TITLE: [20/M] and my girlfriend [20/f] hooked up with my best friend after we broke up but now we're back together. Should I break up with her?
POST: I started dating this girl at my university last Spring. We mutually and amicably decided that we wouldn't be together over the summer but possibly pick back up in the fall. Over the summer she had sex with my best friend [20/M]. We got back together in September but now I can't get the image of them two out of my head. I know we weren't together but I feel very disrespected and broken-hearted that they did this and I'm having a hard time getting past it. I'm starting to think that maybe we should break up. Am I in the wrong for thinking this way? How should I address this situation?
TL;DR:
