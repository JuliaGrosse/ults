TITLE: My (f24) second date with a guy (28) ended incredibly confusing. Was I too much?
POST: Hey everyone! So I met this wonderfully nice guy online. We talked for weeks (both online and phone calls) before deciding to finally meet. Our first date was pretty casual, we both had a drink at a blues bistro and ended the night with a hug. He even called me as soon as we got home and we talked for even longer. We were so excited about the date that we agreed to meet up again the following night. He's busy with an intense program at the moment, so he could only meet up for a couple of hours. He asked to come over which I was excited about. So he does and it starts off great, I make us tea, we talk. We then start to cuddle and that's when things get weird. We spoke the night before about how he wanted to kiss me and that I noticed but I wanted to wait until next time. So as we were cuddling I gradually kept making more and more moves initiating a kiss but he was so frigid and distant. I kept asking if everything was alright and whether I had overstepped and boundaries and he kept saying no. So when we finally kissed it was as if I had forced him into it, so much so that now I was uncomfortable for him. So I backed off and asked again if he was ok and he mentioned not wanting things to go to where they were headed (sex) which I had no intention of. But I guess the cuddling and kiss were too much for him. That night was two days ago and I haven't heard from him since (odd for him since he used to text me everyday). I'm just wondering whether to give him space and let him come talk it out whenever he's ready or confront him about it as soon as possible?
TL;DR:
