SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: Got into argument with my friend who said OWS are stupid, lazy people with no proof for their cause. What is the basis (proof/facts) of Occupy Wall Street Protesters and their cause?
POST: Got into an argument with my friend but I started to realize that I had no evidence or stats to back my claims.  I genuinely support the idea that OWS protesters stand by.  That the top 1% are taxed less and retain about equal wealth as the remaining 99% in the nation. But these are just statements I've read with no real evidence or backing.  No hard statistics.  I went looking for it but all I found was information to the contrary, for example the more income you have the more you're taxed ( So I ask reddit to please help arm me with supported facts and claims defending why OWI are not just complaining lazy people with no basis.
TL;DR:
