TITLE: 2012 Subaru Impreza back at the dealer for the 14th time for the same issues.
POST: Hello, Pittsburgh PA here!

So I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza which was part of the oil consumption lawsuit that just went through.

Back in October I had the short-block replaced because of the issues it was having. All covered under warranty. The dealership has been great, no charges for rentals and generally good people all around....

However, It has been back in the shop 14 times since they did the short-block replacement. Each time something else is going wrong. They blame it on not having a full engine from the factory, and since they just replaced part of it, it is causing the issues. Mind you, I NEVER once had an issue before this.

This last time it was in for 3 weeks. They had their master mechanic tear it down, replace any parts that he thought were bad and put it all back together.

So it is running GREAT, all the small things I noticed have gone away and I thought we were in the clear...

Well, two days ago i noticed oil drips in the garage from sitting over night. Called the dealer and I have to take it back in on Friday. They said if it is something major, they may look into getting Corporate involved. Which I think they should have done by now already.

Is there anything I can do legally with this issues? I know that Im not paying for anything, but if I'm going to have to worry about something going wrong on a weekly basis, that isn't acceptable to me.

Thank you for any help!
