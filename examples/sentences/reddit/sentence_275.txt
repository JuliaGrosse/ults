TITLE: (23/M) need to move on from feelings for friend, advice?
POST: Last year I (23/M) struck up a friendship with a married coworker (20s/F).  We both had some issues going on in our lives and it felt really good to have someone to talk to.  It stayed friendly for a few months until we both admitted that it was starting to become more than a friendship.

Neither of us were interested in having an affair but after another month we started spending a lot of time together.  Eventually she felt that we should have some space from each other, which I reluctantly agreed with.  Looking back now I see that it was the right decision but at the time it really hurt.  I've done my best to keep my distance, but things have been awkward since then because I still feel strongly about her.  I know that it's best for her to stay committed to her marriage, but I'm just having a really tough time moving on from how I feel.  Any advice is appreciated.
TL;DR:
