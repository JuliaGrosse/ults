TITLE: How can I get over feeling so insecure and aggressive?
POST: Hey everyone,
I'm dealing with some pretty strong emotions lately; I'm going to see my doctor on Wednesday but I need some advice from people who've felt similarly. I blow up at the smallest incident, and I feel like my friends are wary of me for it lately.

I'm in a stressful school program, where I feel pressure to be perfect constantly. I quit journalism to get into illustration, and now that I'm here, I feel like I've sacrificed my chance at being "successful" for doing something I love. People tried to talk me out of my career change, and still expect me to go into law because I'm an aggressive debater and an idealist.

Really, I just want to express myself. My highest goal is the security of "fame" or "success" and to me it's dependent on how much people like my work. I never want children or a monogamous relationship because I don't want to risk my chance at being "great". (Also, I'm poly so more people is awesome.)

I'm incredibly insecure, and was brought up with loving but "I'll give you something to cry about" kind of parents. I had a great childhood, but often felt neglected and threatened. I've tried therapy but never felt like I could let my guard down with any of my three therapists. I have a history of "melodramatics", and self-harm. 

I would rather make myself uncomfortable and be known as a "good person" than be happy and have others hate me for being selfish. I don't take chances because there's the risk that I'll ruin my chance at being liked/cool/successful, and people will stop talking to me.

Anyone have any advice?
TL;DR:
