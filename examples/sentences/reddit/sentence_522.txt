TITLE: Reddit, am I a horrible son?
POST: My mom just told me that we would be going skiing for a trip on spring break, and she wanted to surprise me. I am a senior in High School, and I am desperately trying to save money for college. I work 30 hours a week during the school year, and it has me exhausted 24/7, so I love any opportunity to be able to work when school is out. She did this during winter break as well, both times I have been upset and thus made her extremely sad, making me feel like a shitty son. Not only that, but I now have to ask off work, when I am currently in the running for a promotion. I love her but she doesn't get it. Am I right to be mad?
TL;DR:
