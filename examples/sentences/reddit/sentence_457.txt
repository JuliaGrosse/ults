SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [18 M] with my girlfriend [18 F] for 3 months, I don't see any rational reason to break up, I'm just unhappy and don't know if its me or her :(
POST: I'm a freshman in college and I've been dating my girlfriend for almost three months now. We were friends before we started anything, and it felt almost natural for us to be together.

My problem is, for some reason I'm just not happy in the relationship. She is supportive, kind, trustworthy, gorgeous and very social. A lot of friends told us how great we are together. There is no rational reason for us to break up, she is such an amazing person! I don't know why but I'm just not happy here. I'm very much doubting if I'm not happy with her or if I'm not happy in general,  I feel so stupid. What should I do? I don't know how to bring this up with her without hurting her feelings :(
TL;DR:
