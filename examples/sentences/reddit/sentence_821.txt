TITLE: Me [26/F] with my boyfriend [24/M] of 6 months, don't know how to handle my jealousy of his female best friend and housemate
POST: My boyfriend is very close with one of his housemates. She can be really flirty when she's drunk, with everyone. Very much with him. I know he loves me and I know he's not attracted to her, they are just close and one of his many best friends. Sometimes I get really jealous and I know this is not okay because he is loyal to me and always has been. They play basketball every week day and I'm not invited of course because it's not a three person game but it also makes me jealous. Well this past weekend I was busy with some girlfriends from out of town so I couldn't hang out with him, and he was at a party his housemate happened to be at because they have all the same friends. He got extremely drunk and unable to really function anymore so he asked her to walk him home, so she did. Well she was just saying (in front of me) how lovey he was being and how she didn't mind all the compliments at all. And how he was holding her hand. Now I didn't get mad because I have already mentioned my jealousy before and he got really mad at me because she is in no way a threat. They are just really good friends and he hated that I was jealous. So I know I need to choose my battles wisely. But I just want to ask him if they have ever held hands before or if it was just because he was out of control drunk and needed help.
