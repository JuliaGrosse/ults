SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [25 M] with my wife [24 F] of 7 years. Wife is looking to be done for good, I'm trying to fight.
POST: We have been together for 7 years and have 2 small children (2 and 3). 

We have both had issues with impulse control and stepping out of the relationship or causing distance when stress gets high, but we are the best of friends and partners when things are going well.

It feels like our biggest issue is communication, we never speak about the tension until the bomb is already going off.

There is no history of abuse or drugs. There was a social drinking problem on my end for the first few years of the relationship which caused me to be much more distant than I would like.

I've been struggling with being the person I want to be for me, her, and my family since the start, but I've often failed. Relatively recently I have been succeeding in showing her how much I care and who I want to be. She seemed to appreciate these changes.

We have had several breaks over the course of our relationship where she gets space then eventually comes back, but we have never really "started over"

We are currently having one of these breaks, but this time it looks like it may end in divorce. I'm struggling to keep it all together for us and the kids.

I don't know what to do. She doesn't want to discuss, talk about, or go to counseling. 

My current game plan is to give her space, be nice and present as much as possible, and hope for the best.
TL;DR:
