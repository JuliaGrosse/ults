TITLE: I (16F) have a past in self harm.. How to break it to my boyfriend? (19M)
POST: First time poster here. 
So.. Today I went swimming at a mates with my boyfriend. We've been together for about a month and so far he's got the idea that I've had a bit of a shitty past, but I haven't told him about my previous self harm issues. This is a really nerve racking thing to talk about and the need to tell him is there,  but I don't know how or when to start talking about it. I don't want to scare him off! Anyway, we went swimming and I'm fairly certain it was hard to miss any scars I've been trying to hide. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already seen them, and that does nothing but heighten the anxiety of admitting it. Its taken so long to work up the courage to go out into public without pants or stockings on, which ive only done thrice so far, and the last thing I want is to make him uncomfortable. How do I achieve this Reddit? D:
