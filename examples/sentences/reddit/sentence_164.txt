TITLE: Where's a good place to apply for summer jobs?
POST: Looking ahead to the summer I'm trying to figure out where I can get a job. I'm a 20 year-old university student currently based in the uk, and I love summer, sun, beaches etc. so am trying to find a job that will be near or involve those things. I've looked up a bunch of hotels in bora bora and Greece and will contact them asking if they have any employment opportunities, but are there other locations/hotels/jobs I should be looking at that will likewise allow me to enjoy the best that summer has to offer during my off-time? I am a hard worker, so I'm not simply looking for a lazy summer job, just wanting to maybe travel somewhere where I can enjoy myself a lot in the summer.
