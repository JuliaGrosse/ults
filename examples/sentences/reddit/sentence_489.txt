TITLE: What's something that happened to you by complete coincidence that really made you think?
POST: Odd question, but just now on our way home from a night out, we decided to stop by Jimmy John's to grab something to eat. I didn't order anything, and as we were leaving I noticed a completely untouched JJ Gargantuan sub just sitting on the sidewalk next to a full large drink, with a receipt under it from half an hour ago. I felt bad about taking it, but my friend convinced me to. I was SO excited to get home and eat it (being buzzed and hungry made me completely unconcerned about where it came from or anything that could have been wrong with it), but then 2 blocks later we passed a friendly homeless man checking a bin for cans. Homeless people are actually quite a rarity on this campus, and I asked if he would like a sandwich. He sheepishly said he would gladly take some if I was willing to give. Gave him the whole thing, and left feeling good, but a little strange: like I was being watched.
TL;DR:
