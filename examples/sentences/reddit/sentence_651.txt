TITLE: [F19 and M21] He takes forever to respond to my texts, and is still in contact with his ex...
POST: We're not really in a relationship yet, but we've gone out a handful of times over the course of 3 weeks, and seem to be hitting it off nicely. I really like him, and I don't want to seem distrusting, but I think something might be amiss. He is in contact with his ex, his ex still comes over, and once his ex even came over while I was at his house! What gives? We're not really a couple, so am I even in the right for worrying about this? He posts to his twitter while I'm still waiting for his texts so I know he's not as busy as he'd have me think. Any kind of insight into this would help. I know parting with an ex can be difficult, but should I say something? Maybe I could ignore the texting bit, he might be playing hard to get...
Please talk to me, I don't know what to do, or if I should even do anything!
