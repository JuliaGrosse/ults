TITLE: If you quit a job, is the employer required to pay you? If so, is there a time frame?
POST: I know, I know- most people right now are trying to get a job.

Anyway, I have the opposite problem. I quit my job on August 23rd and promptly walked myself down to USPS to send a (receipt requested) letter to notify them to send my last paycheck to my home address versus direct deposit.

Well, it is now the day my direct deposit would have been received so I decided to check to make sure they received the letter. Turns out, they have refused it and it is in transit back to me.

So now I'm left scratching my head wondering if I'll even get paid for the few days I worked before I quit.

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? Are there any legal statutes on my side in this situation? [I'm in NY, if that helps...] Or do I just get shafted if they decide not to pay me? How long can they wait before they're required to pay me if they are required to do so? *AHH SO MANY QUESTIONS!
TL;DR:
