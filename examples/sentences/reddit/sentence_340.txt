TITLE: My (22/f) depressed s/o (25/m) doesn't want help and doesn't know if he wants relationship
POST: cross posted this to /r/depression

My s/o of 2.5 years has been depressed the whole time we've been together. I went through major depression my teen years and have recently just felt better about life I guess in the past year. He's always super negative and pessimistic and it gets taken out on me sometimes.

He's been acting really weird lately and it all came to a head last night. I decided to talk to him about it, and he said he needs some time off. He said he doesn't feel as satisfied by our relationship anymore, and he's been unhappy for a long time in general. i already knew the second part. He's been suggesting in the past few months we move in together this fall when both our leases are up, and a few weeks ago we had a big talk where he told me I'm all he's ever wanted and he wants to build a life with me.

He was crying a lot and saying he didn't think he was cut out for a relationship but he cared about me and wanted me around. I told him he couldn't have both of those things, and he said he didn't want to lose me but he didn't know if he wanted a relationship. I've suggested therapy, exercise, changing his diet, doing something multiple times...he said he feels so alone and has always been this way and doesn't know how to be any other way. I'm giving him a few days of space but i don't know what's going to happen. I can't be with somebody who refuses to help themselves. I feel like I keep putting in all this effort and it's all for nothing. I don't want it to be over but I feel like his depression is too great and we've hit a wall. Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? I feel like I understand what he's saying but I also feel so confused and alone. I feel like he's just giving up on us.
TL;DR:
