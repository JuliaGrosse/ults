TITLE: Where's the best place you've ever worked and why?
POST: I worked for Superstore when I was 15.  I was hired onto the grocery department, and was trained by a guy named Kyle on my first day of work. Let's just say that him and other guys weren't the best influences.....

Here's a list of what we did that made this job awesome:

* First day of training Kyle takes me into the back and shows me how to use my knife to cut open bags of chips and candy so that we could eat the "damaged merchandise". 

* Jalape√±o pepper eating contest (won $20 bucks then puked EVERYWHERE)

* Water fights: We'd use the hoses to soak each other unexpectedly. Best memory I have is when the manager on duty came into the back produce area to see me soaked from head to toe...turns around and walks out the door without saying a word. Hilarious.

* Palet jack relay races: We had manual, electric, and lift jacks in our warehouse. So we'd race the electric ones down the back hall, jump off and ride the manual ones back to the main warehouse area, then jump on the electric one and find a way to lift ourself to the top shelf to grab the flag. I won by pressing the emergency stop button on my buddy's electric jack. ;)

I loved working in the back fridge alone at times, just stocking shelves. It was peaceful. And the rowdy times were awesome too. For a 15 year old guy who didn't have many friends at the time and was very strict to the rules, I gotta thank these guys for showing me how to have fun. Best first job ever.
TL;DR:
