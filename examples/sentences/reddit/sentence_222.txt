TITLE: Reddit, what are your stories of judging a stranger too quickly?
POST: This morning on my walk into work i judged someone way too quickly only to regret it and feeling like a bad person afterwards.

On this cold morning walking into work i see a man that I would classify as a typical bogan (skinny, jeans from the 90's, beanie, flannelette shirt, tattoo on his right temple, sneakers and getting the very last of his cigarette that i would have tossed ages ago, just to paint you guys a picture) i was walking towards him then he towards me.

At this point we are about 20meters away from passing each other and he stops to walk in the grass instead of the sidewalk and starts picking up white pieces of paper, at first i think oh cool he found money but there is too much of it to be cash. Then I go on to think "its probably the front of his house and his just cleaning up" but then my mind goes off very judgmentally and thinks "nah his too much of a bogan to live in the middle of the city its probably a stash from last night" (immediately thinking his a drug-o or something along those lines)

Upon walking past him picking things off the grass the SAP in me avoids making eye contact with this 'drugo' when he stops what he is going looks up at me and says "Good morning, you have your self a nice day buddy!" I respond "Thanks" and keep walking only to realize we was just picking up rubbish and when i turned back he kept walking down the street continuing to pick up rubbish.

At this point i felt horrible for judging this guy who was in fact  a genuine good guy too quickly. Reddit, what are your stories of judging a stranger much too quickly?
TL;DR:
