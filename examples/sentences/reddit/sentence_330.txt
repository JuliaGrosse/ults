TITLE: Me [20 M] with my girlfriend [19 F] of 3 months, says she won't tell me what she wants so I don't do it out of obligation.
POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 months, but we started dating three years ago and broke up for about 9 months. The other day, she told me she felt like I wasn't prioritizing her. This makes sense, since I have finals going on and we're both in college and busy. So I asked her what I could do to prioritize her more: call her more? Skype more often? Compliment her more? Her response was, essentially, "I'm not going to tell you what I want, since then you'd do it because I asked you too and not because you want to. You should *want* to call me, not call me since I want you to."

I really enjoy this girl. This seems so out of character for her, and kind of caught me off guard. She's usually very reasonable about trying to solve problems. We've definitely held the mindset of "us vs. the problem, not her vs. me" in the past, but it's kind of hard to separate the problem from the person at this point.
TL;DR:
