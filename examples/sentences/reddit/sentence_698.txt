TITLE: I [20F] don't feel mentally stable enough to keep a relationship with my SO [19M]
POST: As of late I haven't been myself and am very mentally self destructive. I have been together with this guy for six months but have been seeing eachother for a year. I am head over heels for him and he is for me. 

The reason I do not feel mentally stable enough to be with him is because I will get into these weird moods where I don't even want anything to do the world. I get ridiculously sad and will ignore everyone and sit and stare at a wall for hours. I feel like I'm doing it purposely to him but I don't want to hurt him. I can't even explain it properly. I am just generally an ubhappy person 90% of the time and don't think I shouls destroy someone like I do myself.
TL;DR:
