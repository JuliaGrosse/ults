TITLE: Why can't I get a job?
POST: I have tried using online job finders (Snagajob), I have tried asking friends who are in manager type positions... I have tried cold calls, I have tried showing up with resume in hand... I have tried following up the online applications and physical applications I have turned in via calling the employer I applied too weekly... I have tried applying to mom & pop shops, and large faceless corporations. 

I can say, with absolute confidence... That I have tried applying to over 150 businesses in the last 5-6 months, for all kinds of varying work in almost every salary range. I have only yielded 2 interviews from one business (Books-A-Million), even had a background check done... And nothing came of it. 

Quite honestly, i'm getting tired and i'm about ready to give up, maybe even just off myself. What the fuck is the point of living if I can't even work? I have zero work history, and no experience. I have plenty of skills, yet no one is willing to even let me prove that to them.
TL;DR:
