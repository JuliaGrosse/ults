TITLE: I need some advice about renegotiating my contract...
POST: Reddit, I need some advice. I have been working for almost a year with a company who was supposed to "hire me on" 9 months ago. Everytime I ask about my chances of getting hired on, I get told "We are going to push the contract back (through a contracting service they signed me up with, I didn't have a say) another 90 days. Well it's coming up to my 1 year anniversary of working here and I want to renegotiate things. I want to contract outright with the company. No middleman. Just me. I want to ask for more money that will cover whatever taxes I'll need to pay and give myself a raise. I have been working on having my own company for a few years working freelance graphic work and some side IT jobs here and there. I think contracting outright would be a great experience for me and would look great as far as credibility for my company. And if I am to expect another year of contract work, I don't someone making money off of me that never did anything to earn my business anyway. *vent* So, do any of you have any suggestions as to how to approach this? What are some confidence boosters that you guys use?

I think I've built up enough of a good reputation with the company and put in enough time and effort to show them how hard I work for them. I work for the IT dept and we have over 400 users with an IT Staff of 2. Me and my boss. Needless to say, we have our work cut out for us. We have a few remote sites that spread from Canada to Texas. 

Any advice would be great, sorry if I wasn't clear enough in my question. I am writing this as I run back and forth to offices. It it kind of a question I started typing out at noon and am finishing up now. Thanks for any help. Do any of you have any similar situations? 
Thanks r/jobs!
