TITLE: I [19f] need some advice on what to do with my ex [24m] (x-post from r/Longdistance)
POST: Reposting here since I would like as much advice as I can get. 

Prepare yourselves, this is going to be a bit long. 

A bit of backstory:
Back in December my now ex SO started our relationship - he lived in Ireland and I was in the UK. He then moved to Germany in January for a few months and we still continued to happily be together while he tried to start a career. We kept visiting one another when we could and things were great. He then had a job opportunity in Korea come up and we decided to end things mutually on my last visit due to the increase of distance - we lasted a good 4-5 months being long distance. Since then, we have seen each other a few times (we have a good many mutual friends and met each other in quite a tight-knit community) and I still have very strong feelings for him and we still are trying to be friends even though its difficult controlling our feelings for one another (I know this because the last time we saw each other we slept together again).

Now he's currently back in Ireland and I'm going over there soon for work reasons and have an opportunity to see him again very briefly. We've both been single now for 2 months and it has been hell for me. I want to ask him to give our relationship another shot and tell him how I really feel. I really think that we can work as a relationship again even though the distance between us is going to increase when he moves to Korea in a couple of months. 

Do you guys think this is a good idea?
