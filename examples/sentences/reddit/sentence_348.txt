TITLE: I (18/m) played along with a joke my father (67/m) made and now he won't speak to me or my mother (62/m)
POST: This afternoon I came back from a two week trip out of the country, and as I was talking to my parents I gave them their gift which was very thought out and they visibly loved. My dad joked that I gave him the bag it contained and I told him as a joke that actually the paper wrapping it was the gift. 

Immediately after I said this my dad's demeanor totally changed and he went from extremely happy to see me and in love with the gift to being personally offended and he said if I am going to act like that then I might as well not have gotten him anything. Now he won't speak to me or my mother at all because she made a comment as he stormed off that if he is going to make jokes like that then he needs to be able to take jokes like that.

I know my father can be difficult to deal with and these situations happen all the time, but I'm not sure if I should feel responsible for him getting upset at my mother and I, or am I right in thinking behavior like that is irrational and it's not my responsibility to walk on eggshells when I talk to him?
TL;DR:
