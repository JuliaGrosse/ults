TITLE: Me [20 M] feels weird dating other people after a breakup of 2.5 years.
POST: So i have this feeling that is a little strange after our breakup. A little back story, the relationship was about 2.5 years and it felt like we clicked very well and did a lot of things together. Never really had any arguments or anything like that. It seemed like a really good relationship, we supported each other and made each other better and all that wholesome stuff. She was my first long term girlfriend that really did anything with me and it felt good to be with her. She wanted to see who else was out there in terms of guys so that was the reason for the breakup. I have not really contacted her at all besides her texting me to catch up a bit. Things ended about 2 months ago by the way.

Alright so on to what i am feeling, so i feel like i am still kind of dating her even though we are not talking besides a hello once or twice a month. I feel like i have to ask for permission from her to date other people even though i know that i don't and she is dating someone else already as well. I just can't really shake that feeling that i am suppose to be with her still and it just feels kind of wrong in a way to actually date and do other things with a different girl. I feel like i am cheating but i know that i am not since we are split up. I have been doing lots of things by myself as well like a job change and school and working on myself as well. Does anyone else have this feeling after a long term relationship and maybe how to get over that feeling? Just hard to grasp what to do in this situation. Thanks
