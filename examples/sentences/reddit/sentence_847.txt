TITLE: Jumping so high just to sniff a face...
POST: Hello all! My dog Reggie is a large (85 pound) mutt, mostly boxer/pit/etc. He loves human attention - his favorite thing is to sit on top of someone on the couch (whether he's just met them or known them for years). This is rarely a problem because I hang out with dog people, but meeting new people can sometimes be a pain. 

When someone starts walking up to us and Reggie notices, he starts to pull towards them. I allow this if I know them (perhaps my first problem? Except he is large and usually without harness because he doesn't pull on walks.) Then I await the coming storm - he has about ONE jump in him during the greeting. It is not to put his paws up on a person, the way I've seen other dogs, but really to try to sniff/lick their face. Unfortunately, this means there's a huge dog jumping up at people's faces like a missile. I'm writing this because today, a woman trying to give me a brochure came out of nowhere and handed paper to me, then he jumped up and, since I had him on a short leash, he kind of crashed on his bum in the snow. 

Current training: When we are at home and a friend is coming over, I DO try to train this behavior away by holding his collar, then giving my friend a treat and asking them to tell him to sit. He's extremely food motivated, so this works well. When the initial excitement is over, he does not jump as much for attention.

Final note: if someone makes prolonged, friendly eye contact, he sometimes get excited enough that he tries to jump for the face. I know this well enough that I'll break his attention before, but unfortunately my peers don't understand that staring isn't the way to keep a dog calm...
