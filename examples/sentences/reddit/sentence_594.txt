TITLE: Does this sound like im asking them out??
POST: So there is this guy i work with at the radio station once a week for about an hour and a half, and he is cute and everything but i'm not looking to date anyone right now, and I just wanna hang out with him as friends. However I wanna ask him if he wants to go hang out at the gardens or at a park where there are swings and stuff but I'm a bit nervous because I'm scared if i do that he might think i'm hitting on him and he'll be like lol no see ya, byeeee. I don't know, even though I think he's cute I think just being friends with him right now would be a good thing haha. What do you think?
TL;DR:
