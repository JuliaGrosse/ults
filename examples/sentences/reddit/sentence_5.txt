SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [M, 20] am to go through an arranged marriage at age 30 if I am still single, but I am no success in relationships.
POST: So I'm 20 years old now, and my mother and I came to this agreement a while ago that if I am still single by the time I am 30, then she is to arrange a marriage for me, with a woman from my home country. I don't really know why I agreed to this, but it's not like I absolutely hate the idea. Or maybe I do, I don't really know.

I've never actually ever had a relationship. A bunch of small things have built up the mindset that I have today, and even though I like myself, it seems like nobody else does. I find it difficult to be happy, when I'm always worried about why I can't find "the one" or something.

I guess my life is pretty swell if my worst worries are just troubles of the heart.

No girl I've ever liked has ever reciprocated my feelings. From the first girl I liked to the most recent one [F, 17].

One of my friends told me I was a sort of sicko, because I'm in college now and I was into a girl who was still in high school.

Is there a way that I can change my thinking process, or is there something I just might be doing wrong?
TL;DR:
