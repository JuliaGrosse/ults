SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [19F] feel suffocated by my boyfriend [20M] even though we don't spend a lot of time together as it is
POST: Hey guys, so I'm a sophomore in college and I'm having problems with my boyfriend of 2 years. I'm in a really rigorous program (I was taking 12 classes at the beginning of the semester but I dropped one because it was just too much, so now I'm taking 11). Classes taking up my Mondays-Fridays 8:00am to 5:45pm and after that I have homework and practicing musical instruments.

I have an amazing, faithful, loyal, wonderful boyfriend who goes to school a couple subway stops away from me, but lately I've been feeling like he's being too clingy for my liking. He has a much lighter schedule than I do (he's taking 4 classes) and always wants to hang out whenever I have free time, which is understandable. 

My problem is that I want most of my (very limited) free time to be by myself and just chill without talking to or interacting with anyone. I've been suffering from depression since I was a young child, and he's aware of that as well as all my other issues (some intense emotional abuse in a previous relationship). He's very understanding about all that and I've expressed my need for "me-time" with him, and he said he understood, but I think he was just trying to be nice.

When we do spend time together, for some reason that I can't figure out, I would rather act like friends than boyfriend/girlfriend. I'm really not feeling PDA and my libido has dropped due to all the stress I'm under from school. My boyfriend is way into PDA and very touchy-feely, which I used to be, but not so much anymore. I feel like I can handle school and I can handle my boyfriend, but I can't handle both at the same time.

I can't imagine breaking up with him. He's the sweetest human being I've ever met and I know I need him, I just don't always feel it. I don't know what to do, I can't tell him all this because I'm afraid it would crush him.
TL;DR:
