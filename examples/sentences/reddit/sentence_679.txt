TITLE: Reddit, What are some of your craziest/most fucked up roommate stories?
POST: Anything from crazy nights to hospital visits to waking up in three towns over. I'll start: 

This happened my freshmen year (2years ago) of college. I stayed in one night to catch up on some homework/study while my roommate and some of his friends were going out drinking. 2 hours later I get a knock on my door. It was his two friends. Apparently my roommate decided to steal someone's drink which unbeknownst to him it was drugged with something. Me and his two friends were now tasked with bringing 200lbs of dead weight up stairs to the third floor in a building with no elevator without catching any attention. The night ended with him on the floor of the second floor stair case posted up with a book open and a pair of sunglasses on until the morning.
TL;DR:
