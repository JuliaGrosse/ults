TITLE: Me [29 M] with virtually no friends, is it me? Is it too late for me to make good friendships?
POST: I'm 29 and don't really have any friends. The few that I do have are so preoccupied with their lives that our communication is incredibly sparse. I find I'm fundamentally different than most people I meet, I care deeply about politics, not at all for sports, I love reading, especially math/music/computer science books, etc. I find I am a pretty deep thinker, perhaps more than is normal and it's hard for me to connect with someone who doesn't wonder about anything. 

There are a few friendships I could have made along the way but I felt those individuals were not really sincere, but now I'm beginning to think maybe I just have to high of expectations from people? Maybe I should expect that most people don't TRULY deeply care about you unless you're their romantic interest. There was a guy who was similar too me but ultimately, our relationship didn't grow into as amazing as a friendship as I thought we could have had, namely because our communication was mainly one-way--me reaching out to him, and never quite the other way.

My most recent gf left me, we were arguing too much. She was pretty immature and I am impatient, but maybe I'm just too impatient and it leads to a short temper. Idk. I don't know if it's me, the reason I'm essentially....alone. I just want to make good relationships, I don't want to be alone. I don't want to grow old and die alone because I never made good friendships. Is it too late for me? If I haven't made good friendships by now, am I doomed?
TL;DR:
