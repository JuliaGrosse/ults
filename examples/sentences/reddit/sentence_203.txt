SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Am I [22f] being unfair when my boyfriend [24m] is unsure if he wants me to move to school with him next year?
POST: My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 9 months. I am graduating this upcoming December with my Bachelors degree, and he is already graduated with a degree and now has a full time job. 

He has plans to attend graduate school next fall for 2.5 years to get his dream job that he has worked really hard thus far for. During his undergraduate he had a few minor relationships (5 months or less) and otherwise non-committal flings because he wanted to remain focused on school and his full time job. 

I realize school is very important, but so is a long term relationship. So, at about our 4 month mark together, I asked him if I was going to be apart of his plan on going to grad school or if our relationship was just something he was planning on phasing out by the time grad school came around. I figured 4 months is the time that things start to get serious or we could each go our separate ways without too much damage.  

Fast forward to now: He is applying to grad schools all over the country, everywhere from Michigan (where we are from) to Florida and North Dakota. It is starting to seem very real to me even though he hasn't even been accepted yet. I asked him again today if he wanted me to move with him to school...He said "I'm just not sure where we are going to be a year from now, so I am not sure." Now I understand that is a fair way to phrase that, but it just kindof hurt that he wasn't immediately like "Of course I want you with me!" Am I being unfair for wanting that sort of a response instead of a "Mmmm maybe?" When he does go to school, we will be dating for about a year and a half at that point. 

We are in love, and very easy going people, we never really fight. I just don't want to waste time if he's just going to ditch me for his career some day.
TL;DR:
