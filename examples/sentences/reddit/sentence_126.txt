TITLE: She suddenly stopped talking to me after years of friendship. What does it mean and why is she doing this? [18m] [18f]
POST: after transferring to Boston, I went to school with this girl for 3 years, and its our last year before I leave to California. I've been always close to her as a friend almost her only close guy friend. Ever since I confessed and got rejected, things became awkward, but settled down really quickly and we were good friends again. 

Back to our old relationship, its only been weeks since I noticed her changed behavior to me. She won't initiate conversations anymore, look at me, or anything. Rarely when we come across, she simply says Hi or Bye and walks away. Hate isn't a good word, but more of discomfort and distanced feel.
Why did this happen? What does this mean for her? I'm having really hard time figuring out what I did wrong..

I thought it might've been the stress of college applications, but she gets along with few other guys. (I would know, because she showed me that type of behavior)
TL;DR:
