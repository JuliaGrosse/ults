TITLE: Question about Credit Scores
POST: I read through the FAQ, but I don't think it fully answered my question, so I'll ask it here in hopes someone can clarify it for me.

Earlier this week I went ahead and paid off my car.  A couple years ago I was able to pay off my student loans.  I currently pay my 2 credit cards off (one is a personal card I use for business, one I use for personal items) and almost always maintain a 0 balance at the end of the month.  I live in an apartment I rent, so I do not have a mortgage or any other loans out at this time.  I am 100% debt free as of today.

Now I thought this should be exciting.  I can now save more money and use that to invest in other things I've wanted to do but always put off to get to 0 debt.  When I told my parents about it my Dad kind of scared me that I needed to maintain some form of debt that it didn't impact my credit score down the line.

After reading the FAQ, I learned there are obviously a lot of misconceptions about what does and does not impact your credit score.  Clearly, failing to pay or paying late has a negative impact, and clearly having a high utilization rate also has a negative impact.  But now that I have paid off my 2 big loans (student/car) will that eventually have a negative impact on my score?  I'll continue using my two credit cards, but I have no plans to buy a house or another car anytime soon so I do not forsee myself taking out another loan for quite some time.  Can someone shed some more light on this or offer some advice?
TL;DR:
