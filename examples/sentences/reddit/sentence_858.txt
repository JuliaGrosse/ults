TITLE: My [23F] ex's [25M] mom [40'sF] shared a "On This Day" memory of my ex, his brother and myself on Facebook. His new girlfriend [20's?F] blew up on me.
POST: I'll keep this short.

My ex, Ross and I broke up over a year ago now. We started growing apart and wanted different things out of life. We have kept things civil, kept each other on social media but we don't talk, unless we see each other in public. I have decided to stay single until I finish my masters, but he now has a new girlfriend, Krystal. 

I was very close with Ross's family. I still have them all on Facebook but we don't talk unless it's to wish each other a Merry Christmas, Happy Birthday, etc. Only a handful of times a year out of respect for Ross. They do "like" my posts, especially his mother. I asked Ross if he would rather I unfriend them, but he says he's cool with it and not to worry.

The other day, I received a notification from Ross's mom. She shared a "memory" with me in it; it was of myself, Ross and his younger brother when we were on vacation three years ago. His mom wrote "Miss the beach! Can't wait for summer!"

I thought it was a little weird and awkward to say the least, but I didn't say anything. A few hours later, I received a Facebook message from Krystal, saying:

"u/throwxyz22, I don't know why you feel the need to still keep tabs on Ross's family, but you need to back off. Accept the fact that he is MY boyfriend and please remove yourself as his friend as well as the rest of the family's. I have replaced you and you serve no purpose to be in their lives anymore. Grow up and get over yourself."

I haven't even responded, but I am so confused. I have met Krystal once when I bumped into them grocery shopping. Ross introduced us and we exchanged pleasantries; she seemed really kind.

What do I say? Do I say anything to Ross or his mother? Talk to Krystal herself? I didn't even share the post! I'm so confused.
TL;DR:
