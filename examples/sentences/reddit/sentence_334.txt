TITLE: TIFU by telling a girl I really liked about my recent ex
POST: This happened last Saturday. I had recently broken up with my GF of 3 years, and we still talk and she's been trying to push me onto the dating scene to'move on'.
So, I oblige in the hopes it might help with the break up and stuff, and I recall a girl I was speaking to a few weeks before the break up (nothing bad, just in class at college). She seemed really nice, so I thought "Why not talk to her?". So I did the only thing I could now that college had finished, I found her on FB and messaged her. Things were going well, we hit it off and had even set up a date. A couple of days after she was at a party and stayed on the phone to me drunk for most of the night, so she was obviously into me.

Then the fuck up happened. 

It isn't dramatic, just stupid. I felt pretty bad for trying to date so soon, and I told her this, explained that I'd just broken up with my GF, and that I still had feelings for her etc, but that I thought she was a really lovely girl and that I'd really like to get to know you more. She didn't see it that way and saw herself as a rebound. So I lost out on getting to know a really nice person who I clicked really well with because I tried being honest.
TL;DR:
