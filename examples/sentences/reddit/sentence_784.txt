SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: Looking for a book from my teen years, maybe reddit can help?
POST: I don't remember a whole lot about it, (obviously, or I wouldn't be looking for it). It's along the lines of a Christopher Pike novel, but I know for certain it's not his. 

To start, the cover had a teenage girl, with her face blurred, possibly a hand to her face, what seems like a wooded background, trees, bushes, but still suburban. The only main plot points I can remember are the beginning::  typical twins-separated-at-birth-neither-knew thing. one twin gets murdered, face blown off by a shotgun as she answers the door. Completely unrecognizable. Other twin flies to place (California maybe? Alive twin was in European country)  twin that's still alive takes over dead twin's life, down to mannerisms, friends, whatnot. I remember a gazebo in the yard being a major plot focus, a motorcycle driving by, waiting at the gazebo, and a palm pilot in a hidden desk drawer with an alarm that goes off at a certain time every day. 

That's all I can remember. It was the first in an either two or three part series and it's been bugging me for 10+ years that I cannot remember the title or author or anything. Maybe someone else has read it. I picked it up when I was maybe 13, and I think it was printed in early 90's, but definitely not sure. If anyone has any leads, they would be greatly appreciated!
TL;DR:
