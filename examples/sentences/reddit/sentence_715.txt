TITLE: I hate having sex and just got broken up with over it. Is there any hope of me ever having a successful long-term relationship? (Details inside.)
POST: I'm not sure if this is the right place for this - if there is a more appropriate subreddit please do direct me there...

So here is my deal. I'm on a medication that kills my sex drive. I take the meds for a mental illness and I will be on them for the rest of my life - changing meds or going off them completely is not an option.

I just got out of a 2+ year relationship with a woman who was extremely understanding and whom I loved very much. (I'm a woman too, by the way.) We had sex maybe once every few months, and when we did I couldn't get into it. Over the course of the relationship she started to get more and more frustrated at our lack of sex until finally she broke it off. It was a very amicable breakup and one that we both agreed needed to happen.

Since then I've been thinking a lot about whether I'll ever be able to be in a healthy relationship. My ex was as loving and understanding as a person could be but even she couldn't stay with a person who wasn't able to be intimate. I liked being romantic and cuddling and all of that stuff but sex is just something that my body is not interested in. I tried faking it but found it emotionally exhausting. I just plain don't like it.

I am only 24 and she was my first real long-term relationship, but I can't help feeling very depressed at my relationship outlook. Is there any hope for me to ever find a partner who will want to stay with me long-term despite a lack of intimacy? Should I resign myself to a lifetime of faking it and putting myself through unpleasant sex time and time again in order to maintain a relationship?
TL;DR:
