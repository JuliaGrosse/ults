TITLE: [Final Update] My[22F] roommate is upset at me because I didn't let her drive my[22F] car.
POST: [OP here](

[Second Update](

If anyone else was interested in what happened with me and my roommate, thought I'd give a final update.

Last time we got into an argument because she refused to split the electricity bill half and half and just make me pay her my half at the end of the month, but last year I never remembered to ask her the amount of each month so at the end of the year I owed her about $200, she told me I was making things complicated and I'd have to go through many steps to be added to the account, went into her room and closed the door on my face.

Well a lot of people told me to cut her out of my life but I wasn't too sure about it since I had known this person for about 5 years but we've been roommates for a year. 

I finally got the balls to tell her after a week that I was moving out because I did not want to argue anymore and it was ruining our friendship. She got upset at first and told me that things would change (but she'd always tell me this whenever we'd argue) and I told her that the line has been crossed and she had to learn that her actions had consequences since she's always just say'sorry' and though things were better. 

I don't want to get into much detail about the moving process but I finally moved out, and I'm typing this at my new place. I'll be honest, I'm scared shitless cause I don't know anyone else and I don't hang out with anyone else (and pets are not allowed here) but I have a semester left so I'll make it work. 

As for my roommate and I, we talked a few hours ago about the old apartment (she got a new roommate), got into an argument again and I left. I don't know what will happen next but I'm just happy I can come hope to a quiet and relaxing home.
TL;DR:
