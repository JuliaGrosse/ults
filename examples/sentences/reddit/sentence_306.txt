TITLE: Me [24 M] with my ex [24 F] of 4 years. Should I seek closure after years of no contact.
POST: Hi reddit,  

Me and my ex shared one of those big, only-a-few-times-in-your-life relationships. Unfortunately it didn't work out as most relationships don't when you go from being a teenager to a panicking semi-adult.  

The break-up was somewhat messy, but nothing insanely bad. I'm sure she regrets some things as do I.  We were both on the cusp of  change and although our ambitions and life goals had never NOT been aligned, I think the relationship itself just got too big for us. This combined with the honeymoon period puttering out eventually suffocated the whole thing.  

We've barely been in contact in two years. Pretty much not at all. I think I sent her a letter a year ago saying that even though we both got burnt, I was still happy that we had gone through the experience.  She never replied and I would've been shocked if she did.  

Here's my problem. I don't think I'm completely over her and I don't know if she is either. But then again, two years is a long time and I have made some headway. I know what went wrong. What I messed up and where she messed up, but the knowledge barely gives me any comfort.  I think the thought of her scares me. Seeing and talking to her scares me like a shock of electricity, ya dig? So I think, if we'd just meet and talk maybe I'd be easier to work through it.  

It's a mess. I'd love to get advice from others who've been in my position. Does the elusive 'closure' actually exist? Do ex's get together again?  

Thanks.
TL;DR:
