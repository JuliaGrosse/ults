TITLE: Reddit, I think I'm ready to switch back to a Windows 7 laptop after switching to OSX 4 years ago. Thoughts?
POST: So heres the lowdown:

I own a 2006 15-inch Macbook pro. It survived four years of college and the abuse that entails wonderfully. However, It's age is starting to show and I will be starting a new job soon and think it's time to upgrade. I looked into the price of a new Macbook pro 15 inch with all the features I would want (500 gb HD, at least 4 but maybe more gigs of RAM) and it's like $2700.

I bootcamped my mac and installed Windows 7, and it makes me think "Hey, maybe I could save a whole bunch of money and get an even faster laptop!" So with that thought, what are some windows machines that are comparable or better in terms of speed?

The last thing is design. The macbook pro is beautiful and works well. Are there any windows machines that can match that level of design and quality?

NB: I will also use it for some gaming, so something that can play all the latest stuff is a big plus.
TL;DR:
