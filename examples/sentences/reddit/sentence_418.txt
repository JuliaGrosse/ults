TITLE: How do I [22F] stay friends with my ex hookup [23M]?
POST: I started hooking up with this guy a little while ago, a really nice dude that I got along with really well. We had nothing in common at all, but could talk for hours about everything and we have the same goofy-but-mature vibe going on I suppose. We both liked each other but had to keep it light cuz there was a post-graduation expiration date.

He ended it after a few weeks but we decided to stay friends. We talked about it twice, where he admitted that he thought I liked him more/would expect more from him after we graduated and ended it early because he didn't want to hurt me by not wanting the same thing, and he thought it would be better if we weren't romantically involved "for now". But he said that he really wants to keep in touch even though we haven't known each other for that long (about 2 weeks before we started hooking up) because he enjoys talking to me and doesn't feel that way about a lot of people. He said he likes me as a person and cares about what happens to me in the future, and got mad at me when I questioned him, telling me adamantly that I just had to trust that he meant what he said. I know it sounds like he's feeding me lines, but we talked about this for three hours and I really do believe him when he says he cares.

I told him that I wanted to keep in touch too but I didn't know if I could because I still liked him while he obviously had managed to set all of that aside, so he said he would leave it up to me. I really do want to, he's such a great guy, but I know now is not the time for that. But I don't want to cut him out or ignore him and make him feel like the things he said didn't mean anything to me because they do. Is it rude if I wait a few months to contact him? Do I need to tell him that that's what I want to do or can I just drop him a line to say hi later on?
TL;DR:
