SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [20F] with my ex [20 M] of 3 1/2 years. He broke up with me because he no longer feels the same.
POST: Just over a week ago my boyfriend broke up with me completely out of the blue. He said he doesn't love me anymore and just doesn't feel the same. I was devastated but this is the 3rd time he has broken up with me. From previous experience I knew not to cry and beg and I have barely spoken to him since. I don't regret at all getting back together with him as we had been happy together for 2 years after the last break up. I told him when we broke up that if he changes his mind about us to let me know and we could try and work it out. 

Last night he sent me a text at 3 in the morning saying "Breaking NC. Miss talking to you. I keep looking at your reddit posts. We can't talk I shouldn't text... Ahhh Fuck. Just letting you know"

His message really upset me because I can see hes taking the break up badly and I don't know what to do. I would like to get back together with him but I don't know what to make of his text last night...
TL;DR:
