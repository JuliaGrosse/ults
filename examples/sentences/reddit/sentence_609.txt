TITLE: Me [24 M] with my best friend [25F] of 5 years, I'm in love with her and it's paralyzing
POST: Throwaway because friends know my username. I met my best friend 6 years ago at university and we've been really close for about 5. For most of that time she went from relationship to relationship, one of which lasted for 3.5 years with someone I also considered a good friend. 

I've dated many people throughout this time, but I subconsciously find myself comparing them to her. This often causes me to be resistant to commitment and easily lose interest in romantic partners.  

We're both single and talk every day. She was my date to a wedding last week, I go to dinners at her parents house, and we take each other to work events. We always have an incredible time together, feel comfortable being ourselves, and are both attractive (trying to be objective here) and have successful careers.  

I am a big proponent of not convincing someone to be with me unless they really want it themselves. I also have a tendency to get paralyzed when I don't know what to do. So how do I proceed?

A) Be upfront about how I feel and potentially alter our friendship
B) Continue to see other people and try to find someone right for me that I won't feel the need to compare them
C) Try to be at peace with it and focus on other important things in my life
D) Sell all my possesions, and move to a different place every 4 months determined by a poll on a blog I have yet to create
TL;DR:
