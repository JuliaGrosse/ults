TITLE: What are some good extracurriculars I can get into?
POST: I'm looking to get into an elite college. I have good academics but I know that won't help me fly into an elite college easily. I go to a "poor" high school (according to my peers) allegedly, but I see that my options for extracurriculars are very limited.

I want to be a computer science major when I go into college, just keep that in mind.

I want to go into an elite college. Not talking Ivy League, with the opportunities given by our school, that's hardly possible, but I have my eyes set on Cornell University because I believe I can make it if I truly try.

So that's the thing about those top elite colleges, they don't just want academics, they want extracurriculars, so what can I do that'll help me in the admissions process? I'm an open-minded person that loves trying new things, meaning that I'm not asking just for the sake of getting into a good college.

I'm currently a dancer (company/performance level), school tennis player (Varsity division), and policy debater (Varsity division). I volunteer at the local debate league to judge tournaments for middle school students enrolled in their school's debate program, which gets me a few dozen hours but not adequate.

For next year I'm looking to do National Honor Society (community service and tutoring) and math team (might help for my STEM major).

Since my school's ECs are pretty limited I'm preferably looking for something I can do outside of school in my own time. Tennis and debate particularly take up most of my after school time so other school ECs wouldn't work well because of conflicting schedules, but I think I can be well-off with something outside of school.
TL;DR:
