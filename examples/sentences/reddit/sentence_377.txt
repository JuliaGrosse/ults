TITLE: TIFU by staying too late at school
POST: This happend about an hour ago so the pain of it is still fresh.

I'm a Junior studying mechanical engineering at a college in Ohio. Ohio weather, if you don't already know, can go for sunny and warm to windy and cold in a matter of hours which is exactly what happened today. 

Around 4pm (weather is mid 40's and sunny) I finished my classes and decided that I'd like to "get work done" so I walked back to the engineering building. I found a study room in the basement and proceeded to do work, browse reddit/Imgur, and listen to music. Not much work was getting done but whatever, so I stayed a while. 9 pm rolls around and I realize that I need to get home and get food. I leave the engineering building and lo and behold it's snowing. I trudge through the fairly shallow but slippery snow to my house. On the way there I nearly slip, but my amazing sense of balance saves me from eating shit in the street.

I make it to my house where I run upstairs to drop of my bags so I can chill with house mates in our living room. At the top of the stairs all hell breaks loose. I slip on the top step and proceed to fall all the way down. The fall, which my roommates witnesses, was very reminiscent of a Home Alone movie. I hit my left leg on every stair on the way down but managed not to flip over. So now, I'm sitting typing this on my couch with my leg, which is in much pain and very swollen, elevated and I'm using frozen vegetables to ice it. Shits embarrassing and painful.
TL;DR:
