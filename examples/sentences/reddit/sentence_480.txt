TITLE: [22/f] ex boyfriend [45/m] two timing old man.
POST: So I've been dating this guy for about 8 months, he has 3 children which I take care for in the afternoons he hired me as his nanny, his wife passed away 3 years ago. 2 month ago I discovered he was dating someone else and well I got upset and ended things, I was going to quit as his nanny but then he started paying more, so money was good and I stayed. Sometimes occasionally I stay late and we drink wine and just talk. The other day another female coworker (another teacher from school, not coworker in his home) told me he had been hitting on her and she replied back telling her she knew about us and how we had things, he denied it and practically called me a liar. My coworker was just shocked by his assholeness and told me. I was not amused and just mentioned him that it hurt me, I didn't care if he was hitting on other people but the fact that he was calling me a liar and that nothing had happened did get me upset. So this other girl I caught him with, she doesn't know we where dating either, she just thinks I'm his nanny, and he moves the world I swear to make me and her not meet (even though I don't care he is seeing someone else, well i do but I'm working on getting over him) so last night I had a few cups of wine and emailed the girl he is dating know (which she already replied saying she's been dating him for 2 years!!). I emailed because I had enough of his bullshit and as a woman to another woman I wanted to let her know what he had done to me, dated me while still with her, and the way he lies. She said she wanted to meet tonight and talk about everything which I do want to, but I don't know if I should. Now that I'm sober I don't want to get involved in his drama again, but I don't want him to lie to this other poor girl that has no clue (I mean two years!!!) should I meet with her, or just leave it like that?
TL;DR:
