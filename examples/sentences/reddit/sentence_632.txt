TITLE: My [24 F] partner is having a crisis and I [23 M] don't know how to deal with it
POST: As a background, me and my partner have been together for 4 years. Everything has been pretty good until recently. She comes from a rough background, she was put up for adoption when she was really young and when we first started dating she became part of the family.

Recently she's had a major identity crisis. She's been unemployed almost the entirety of our relationship, with odd jobs like paper rounds. Her mental state and anxiety keeps her away from more permanent jobs, but we're working on that.

While she's been at home unemployed, she gets really obsessive over certain things online. First it was Youtube, she would be so involved in Youtube personalities, and when there would be a youtuber that would come to our city (Toronto) she would want to drop everything to go see if we could meet them, and then freak out and cancel when the day would come.

Recently it's been tumblr, she's caught onto tumblr since "activist" Suey Park took offence to Stephen Colbert and since has been following activist, feminist and sjw tumblr blogs. I'm all for her supporting certain movements, even if I don't agree with them, but it's just got to be too much.

She now proclaims to be a feminist, doesn't identify with being female anymore she is now "xe" as she is "gender neutral" and just jumps onto the biggest tumblr sjw bandwagon that's going around that day.
Every time I try mention it, suddenly she gets angry, claims that the "patriarchy" is forcing her to assume stereotypical gender roles. She has a lot of psychological problems as it is, and this just makes it worse.

I love this girl, and despite her problems, I want to be around her. My family loves her, my friends love her. This is just too much, and I don't know how to go about weening her off Tumblr in a way she'll agree to.
TL;DR:
