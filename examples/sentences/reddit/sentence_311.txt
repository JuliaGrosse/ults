TITLE: Need advice about something I did but can't remember
POST: Maybe a dumb question, but here it goes: I was blackout drunk last Thursday and can't remember anything. However, my roommate told me today that I had come in to her room that night and explained everything that happened and that I was really upset about it. All in all, it sounds like I was just really drunk and making an ass of myself in front of strangers at a bar, but I was alarmed by one thing she said. Apparently I ran from the cops. I had been stumbling outside of a bar (I have no recollection of this) and two officers came over to talk to me. We may or may not have not exchanged words because I may or may not have been kicked out of said bar (again, I have no recollection of this). But at some point I took off running. That I ended up at my house means I got away, but could I still be detained now for something like public drunkenness or resisting arrest if the cops recognize me?   I really have no idea how serious the situation was and I'm tempted to call them up, tell them what happened, and if they need me to come down to the station. Should I do this? I live in a small town where I recognize people pretty readily, so I would not at all be surprised if the same cop would be walking the same beat next time I'm downtown.

So yes, totally stupid. I feel really awful about it and just want to come clean with whoever I need to and apologize. It's just that I don't have all the facts and it could be nothing...or it could be more serious. I'm leaning towards not calling because the bar certainly knew who I was (they had my ID and card) and nothing has happened. Then again, I wouldn't want to be stopped later.
TL;DR:
