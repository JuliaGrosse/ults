TITLE: TIFU because I had a boogie
POST: Happen last night. I just drop this wonderful beautiful girl at home, but I must confess what happen during dinner. We were having a great time. Laughing and playing around. She was just as immature as I am. We were telling stupid jokes and all and when the waiter came by to delivery our food she mention the he looks like a gyarados from pokemon and I lost it. 

Now for the record I just got over a cold and my nose was a bit stuffy and I took some cold medicine which in turn dried my nose up. I felt the boogers were loose but I didn't blow my nose like a normal human being. With that said that hard laughter became my down fall. I felt this booger leave my nose and hit her French onion soup. The terror I felt when I saw the splash. The horror when I notice she didn't see it. The relief that I was in the cool. The panic of telling her what just happened. The disgust I felt when I watched her eat the soup. The fuck I gave afterwards because I cannot tell her what happened. I pretended nothing happen and continue our date. 

At the end of the night she wanted a kiss. I told her I still felt the affects of my cold and said we will kick it another time. 

I will not be calling her again. Woe is me.
