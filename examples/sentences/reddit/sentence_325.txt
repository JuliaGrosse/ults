TITLE: [21/M] My GF [27/f] Wants time alone,I'm austistic, What am i suposed to do?
POST: So this relationship has been going on for 2 years, We've had some problems so i went for a trip, seeing my family and such for a couple of weeks and things were much better when i got home between us.
Now, things are still much better than before, but see told me today she didn't want things to go back as before and that she is overworked, needs some time alone to regain energy. I understand that. I'm unemployed and she's asking me to hurry up getting a job. I'm searching everyday, but the thing is, even if i got a job from 9-5, She still works (her own business) to 7-8 everyday. So i would still be home when she got home. So what am i supose to do to give her some alone time? I can't go out everynight to a bar. And going on another trip i can't afford.
TL;DR:
