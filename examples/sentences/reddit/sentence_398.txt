SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me (M21) and GF (20) of 3 1/2 have what i consider to be a terrible sex life and I'm not happy about it.
POST: When we first started dating, we had a fairly decent sex life, probably having a lot to due with the fact that it was a reconnection after dating for a while and then being apart for a few months. 
After about a year things dropped to nothing really quick. We actually went 7 months without any sexual contact (not for my lack of trying)
I got her to talk about it eventually, without any breakthroughs but some intimacy returned occasionally but rarely so I just went with it hoping it would come back gradually.
Fast forward to about a year ago. intimacy was still rare (1, 2, maybe 3 times in a month if i was lucky), but i took a chance and opened up about some rather kinky interests of mine that i wont go into here. She tried to act supportive but never got into them.
Now our sex life is still mediocre at best if im being honest, being about as often as previously stated. When we do have sex, there is no passion on either end; her not being open on what i can do for her to make it better for her and me honestly starting to hate having sex with her because I'm tired of trying. When i try to suggest doing something kinky or anything different (always missionary because that's what she'll do and doggy if I'm lucky), she acts like its the biggest inconvenience ever. Occasionally she'll reluctantly take part in a main fetish of mine but makes it clear the whole time that she hates it and acts very passive aggressive when i try to make the experience better or acknowledge her discomfort and offer to stop.
With the lack of sex and passion I'm left rather unhappy in my situation. All i do recently is picture myself with someone else because of this. I don't want to leave though, I do love her very much, at least i think i still do, but this situation just messes with my head and heart.
TL;DR:
