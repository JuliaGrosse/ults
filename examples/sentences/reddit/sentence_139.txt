TITLE: Me [27M] with my father-in-law [55M] of <1 yr, wants to put my name on his business-related documents
POST: I have a PhD in chemistry and my father-in-law is starting a business that helps companies write grant proposals to get R&D money from the government. He wants to put my name (and PhD title) alongside his on business cards and other marketing stuff related to the company, since a science PhD lends credibility. The thing is, I don't actually have anything to do with this company and I'm worried that if any of his business deals go sour or if he leaves people with a bad impression, it could affect my reputation and future career prospects.

I let myself be pressured into allowing him to list my name on his website as someone who does consulting for his company, but not as an employee or partner. He just sent me a business card that has my name listed alongside his and some other random PhD that has nothing to do with his business. I want my name removed from this, and excluded from anything else going forward.

Here's the problem: my wife [24F] things that my refusal will cause a large blow-up where her family will accuse me of "not caring about family" and other such nonsense to guilt me into consenting. This is exactly what happened when I stopped my wife from unknowingly signing as a guarantor on a business loan for her brother that we wouldn't have been able to afford to repay if things went wrong.

My wife thinks we need to make up polite excuses to get out of this. I just want to tell him that I'm not comfortable having my reputation attached to a business that I have no part in. Technically, being employed by another company is a violation of my current contract, so these cards in the wrong hands could get me fired.

Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated!
