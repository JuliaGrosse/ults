TITLE: I [22 M] don't know if my girlfriend [22 F] is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.
POST: Hi, Internet Strangers,

I've been with my current girlfriend for nearly two years now. I've very into science and technology while she is very arty. I don't really feel that we have so many common interests. 
It can be frustrating when I notice something in the world, and she just can't see it; for example she couldn't explain to me what caused the Coriolis effect. I don't think that she's stupid at all, we both go to Cambridge. She just seems to lack common sense about the natural world.

She often feels that she is'stupid' or 'unsuccessful'.

On the other hand, we are excellent at keeping each other company and both love each other very dearly. She is kind, generous and funny.
I can't help but feel that this is near the minimum of what makes a great partner. Most people can be kind and keep one from feeling lonely.

I've recently been offered a dream job in another country for after my degree and I'm worried that if we end this now I won't be able to find another companion like her before leaving.

I'm becoming very sad about this. We've spoken a little on the topic of shared interests, but I don't think that she knows the full extent of my feelings. We discussed trying new things together, and listed a number of things that we have in common. I don't know if any number of new things can make her more curious about the universe.

Sorry if this was a little scatterbrained :/

Thanks, Internet Strangers.
TL;DR:
