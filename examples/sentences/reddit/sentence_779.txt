TITLE: I am covering for my friend's affair and hate it
POST: I (28/f) have been friends with...let's call her Heidi (32/f)...for about a year. She is from Germany but has been married to an American man for about 5 years. She's absolutely miserable in her marriage but relies on her husband financially and also to stay here in the US. He's a strange guy but I like him and don't want to see him hurt. Heidi recently met a man who she is smitten with and has started up an affair with him. She has been using me as a "cover up" and tells her husband she is out with me when she is really out with the new guy. Her husband doesn't think twice because I'm a nice girl and he really trusts me. I can certainly see both sides of the story here since I've been in miserable relationships, though I prefer being honest with your partner. I know she can't really leave her husband easily because of her circumstances, but I hate being the person to cover for her. She seems incredibly happy, almost like a different person. I feel that she will be found out and I will end up being a bad guy in all this. She doesn't have a lot of other friends to cover for her either if she carries on with this. Does anyone have any advice for me?
TL;DR:
