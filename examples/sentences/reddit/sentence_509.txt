SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of 5 months, am not physically attracted.
POST: I have been dating someone for the last 5 months. He is sweet and gentle and kind and is the most respectful person I have ever been with. I could easily see how I could marry a man like this – the option isn't something I am truly considering yet, just a descriptor – and would love to spend the rest of my life with a person like him. 

However, I've begun to notice that while I am no less happy emotionally, I don't think I'm really all that physically attracted to him. It would be a different story if it were his body that I did not respond to (have previous experience with this), but it's his face that I, in all honesty, am not happy with. If I could change it without hurting his feelings, I probably would.  

It isn't something that I would ever leave him for, and I am happy emotionally with the relationship and have never felt this comfortable with someone before. However, I feel like it is starting to strain our sexual relationship as well and what should I do about it?
TL;DR:
