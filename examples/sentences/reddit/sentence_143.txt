TITLE: My wife's feelings have changed after 6 years, do I try and make it work for the sake of our kids?
POST: I'm a 28 year old male and I've been with my wife (38 y/o) for almost 6 years- we have a 3 year old girl together and two older kids (7 and 9) from her first marriage that I've raised since they were toddlers. My wife has collectively took every bad thing about me like a sword and stuck it right through me...I've only looked at her thru loving eyes even when she did things that hurt me I always looked at all of her positive qualities, every day, all the time. So much so that I had NO idea that she felt the way she did! Should I try to work it out for the sake of the kids, especially my baby daughter who is the star of my life or just finally let go? I came from a broken home but I was born and didn't meet my father until I was about 7...I harbored a lot of resentment towards him and I don't want the kids having that same resentment towards me because I'm not choosing to leave, but how can I stay in a home where I'm not wanted?
TL;DR:
