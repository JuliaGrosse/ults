TITLE: LDR boyfriend has great job offer even further away. What do we do?
POST: I (24 F) have been in a LDR with my BF (24 M) for almost two years. I've been in Canada the whole time but halfway through he moved to the states for school about a 5 hour drive away. We see each other about once a month. It's tough but we've decided it's worth the effort to make it work.

He's now interviewing for jobs. He's in software so there's a ton of stuff out there, especially in the San Francisco area. He's got a great and lucrative offer there and a great but not as high paying offer in the same city as me (which overall has less opportunity in software compared to San Francisco).

I'm in school for public relations, and going to finish this year. Obviously my prospects aren't as good as his.

We're both struggling with what to do. We want to live in the same city. Does he take the job in the states and risk me not being able to get a visa or take the safer (probably less exciting) option here? We might get married as a last resort but neither of us wants to do the green card marriage.

I guess this is a question about him but we're trying to figure this out together.
TL;DR:
