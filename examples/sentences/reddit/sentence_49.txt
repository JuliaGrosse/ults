TITLE: eBay account hacked, not sure what to do next
POST: Part of me loves eBay, the other half hates it. A few days ago, my eBay and Paypal accounts were both hacked. Thankfully, I got my eBay account back. The hacker listed 20 or so copies of Adobe Acrobat, of which 7 sold, two people bought one each, and one dude bought 5. Obviously, I don't have the items to actually sell, so I filed to cancel the orders. I messaged the people who bought them alerting them to the situation and that I don't have the products to sell. However, there was some internal error and I had to log in to my PayPal account in order to issue the refunds. This is where things get messy. After 3 or 4 days, I've not heard back from any of them. I can't get into my PayPal account as that was breached as well and I've not had luck getting back into it. I'm at an impasse. Should I use my own money in order to issue the refunds even though I don't have access to the nearly $600 this hacker scammed these people out of, or should I leave things as they are? I don't think I'll be able to get back into my PayPal account as the email address I used for it all those years ago has been long since lost to time (domain for host got sold).
TL;DR:
