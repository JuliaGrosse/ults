TITLE: Is this irony? And what should I do?
POST: So backstory, my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 15 months now and we're in a long distance relationship (about 2 hours apart). Now I get to see her a few days out of the month and it started getting hard. So I decided to transfer, even if I didn't really want to. She kept telling me to do what I wanted and that I probably wasn't doing the right thing. She always wanted me to transfer but I guess she didn't want to feel guilty about me leaving just for her. And she kind of guilts me into coming home, saying that I like partying more than her. But I am deciding to come home anyway. So anyway she got an email from her guidance counselor tonight about applying for a full year study abroad at Oxford university (another country). And now the only thing holding her back is me. I want to be supportive and tell her that she should follow her own advice. But I really don't want to lose her. I can't help feeling selfish for wanting her to stay.
TL;DR:
