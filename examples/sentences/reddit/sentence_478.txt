TITLE: Is it a requirement that you dont shower or wear deoderant to show at Wholefoods?
POST: Ok, so I started going into Wholefoods because one opened near me and they have a pretty damn good menu in the Wholefoods cafe.  Over the past few weeks I have noticed that people shopping here do not practice proper hygene.  I have encountered some rank clouds of BO, the kind of smell you get when you pass a homeless person kind of BO.  Until this experience in Wholefoods the only other place I have seen these types is at the Apple Store or at the Comic Con or E3.  Is it that hard to hop in the shower a few times a week and use some fucking antiperspirent?
TL;DR:
