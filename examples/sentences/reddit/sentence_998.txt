TITLE: Am I obligated to respond?
POST: I was dating this girl very casually in November/December. She's 23, I'm 26. It kind of died off on its own, though since then we hooked up once, which was last weekend. 

In the month or so between our 3 or 4 dates and the hook-up, she slept with her ex-boyfriend once, which is of course fine; I'm not interested in dating this girl, and after we hooked up last week I realized immediately that we wouldn't do it again. 

Here's the thing: she's been emailing me a lot, asking to hang out, etc. I've been politely saying I'm too busy (which happens to be true), hoping she'll get the hint. Then last night, she sends me an email where she's just *wasted*, talking about how her bday is on Thursday and the anniversary of her father's death was two days ago, and basically all this stuff that I would probably need to be with her there for if we were in any way dating. 

But we're not. But she's clearly sad (according to this email at least), and going through some stuff. I don't want to just ignore her, but I don't want to get involved in a way that seems like I'm interested in her. And to be honest, and I don't mean to be a jerk, but I'm not really interested in being friends, either. I'm super busy with work and we both have separate groups of friends anyway. What do?
TL;DR:
