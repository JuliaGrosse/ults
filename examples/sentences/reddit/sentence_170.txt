TITLE: TIFU by sharing a meme picture in a Facebook group chat
POST: This happened about a year ago, it came up in my mind because I thought this was a good FU.

Anyway, me and my friends made a group chat on Facebook for the three of us. We decided to talk about ridiculous things, like politics, girls, world news, and how was our day etc. Nothing too bad, just a normal chat.

One day, my friend invited my best friend's sister to the group chat (at this time, me and the friend were friends with her on Facebook). As starters, I was not thinking straight and said "What's up X" (X is referring to my best friend's sister). Without realizing, I posted a picture from my computer that had an internet meme that was a sexist joke to girls. 

She saw the message and picture, deleted me and my friend and my best friend was not allowed to see me for a while (she showed it to her parents).

I immediately felt like shit and apologized to her parents and her herself. They all accepted and forgave me though. To this day, I'm surprised her boyfriend is not angry at me.
TL;DR:
