TITLE: I (19M) am more emotional that gf (19F). How do I act?
POST: We've been together for 5 months now, and I'd initiate most of the contact between us. She's really passionate about the relationship and I can tell that she enjoys being around me, but sometimes it's like she's not interested at all.

Obviously I've been suppressing this and forcing myself to text her less and so on, but should I just tell her frankly how I feel?

It's her first relationship, so I've been assuming she's not used to the concept, which explains the way she acts. Am I wrong?

I would've told her how I feel ages ago, but she mentioned that she turned this guy down before we started dating because he "needed too much attention". Should that affect my actions?
TL;DR:
