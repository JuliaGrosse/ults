TITLE: Fwb [19f] of 2 months mad that I'm [29m] screwing other girls?
POST: My fwb, let's call her Madison, is upset that I'm fucking 2 other girls. She won't directly say WHY but she becomes cold/passive aggressive whenever the topic comes up. The other night she asked me why I'm seeing these girls, why am I wasting my time etc and I answered honestly. We still had great sex but that convo was stressful and I can tell she wasn't happy

I'd like to keep her in my life (she has an amazing body, and fucks the way I like) and I want things to be chill between us like it was at the start. 

What's the best way to keep things smooth? I figure I could lie and say I'm only seeing her but I dont like lying. Any advice is appreciated thanks
