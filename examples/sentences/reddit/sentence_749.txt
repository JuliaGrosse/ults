TITLE: Me [19 M] with my SO [19 F] suddenly stops talking to me with no warning sometimes.
POST: We've been really good friends for several years and harbored feelings for each other for most of that time. 
We've been "together" for a few months now, and everything has been going very well. We never really fight and when we do we're able to discuss things pretty openly and calmly so we can come to a resolution.

Unfortunately, we live about 8 hours away from each other. She visits her family here often and she has plans to move back home ASAP, but it's still pretty taxing. 

The only real problem I have is that occasionally she will just stop talking to me. There's no warning for when it happens. The silence  typically lasts 3-5 days. It really sucks and I don't ever know what to do when it happens. I've brought it up to her before, but we never really come to any sort of resolution. 

Is it okay for me to be upset by this? I've had a string of very unhealthy relationships prior to this, and I've picked up a bad habit of minimizing my feelings for the sake of other people. She's done a lot for me and I don't want to make a big deal over something that I have no right being upset about.
TL;DR:
