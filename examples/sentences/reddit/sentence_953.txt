TITLE: Me [23 M] the girl i've been seeing [20 F] for about 3 months, just seems distant since a certain incident
POST: I've been seeing this girl for about 3 months. Everything has been really amazing so far but I need to provide some background.

We have hooked up/seen each other twice before this but I ended it most recently in the middle of last year because I felt she still had feelings for her ex of about 2 and a half years.
as it turned out I was somewhat right and they had a brief moment late last year but it soon ended. She has told me she hates him and doesn't want anything to do with him.
Her ex and her also share the majority of friends so they do bump into each other regularly.

Anyway, we began seeing each other again and it's been really great no issues at all.
Anyway she went out about a week ago and her ex was there and she said they spoke and she has decided to be nice to him in an attempt to make things easier because she does have to see him a bit. She didn't tell me this and the only reason I found out is because I asked why she was tagging him in things on FB.
I've since found out he has spoken to her since and it's just bugging me, and again she didn't tell me that he had.

We've spoken it about it and how it's the only issue between us because she has gone back to him before why wouldn't it happen again? And it slightly worries me.
She has assured me it won't and she only has eyes for me, but I just get such a nagging feeling about it.
This has been compounded by her being quite distant all week for other reasons which has sent me in over drive.

I really just would like some guidance here as I'm not sure what else I need to do to stop my mind going into overdrive.
TL;DR:
