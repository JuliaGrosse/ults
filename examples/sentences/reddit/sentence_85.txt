TITLE: TIFU By Getting Herpes and Destroying My Phone
POST: Basically after helping my father to build an amazing, quality hand-built dock on our vacation home's canal-seawall; I nefariously sneaked away to smoke a pipe with an old hippie who did work there regularly. This was against my better judgement, and I would later find I would eat my words "that was just what I needed!" as I passed the pipe that was chalked black with what could only be years of dank marijuana. And dank it was... Fast forward to Today and I'm racking my mind as to what finally gave me Herpes Simplex, and then it comes to me; it's the same reason my phone was in my pocket when I fell into said canal, and has to buy a new phone for $287: TO SMOKE WEED!

as a growing adult; you now when it's a sign you should stop doing something for a while and grow a little!
TL;DR:
