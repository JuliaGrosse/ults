TITLE: bf [22] responding to craigslist posts behind my [24] back
POST: I f[24] have been with my boyfriend [22] for about five months now. We began as a casual hook up and it slowly progressed into a relationship. During that time he talked to many other girls but there was no commitment between us so I wasn't too bothered. It did however, make me question how much I trust him because he rarely told me about these girls, even when we began to get much more serious. This fear was confirmed when I caught a glimpse of his email account. He had numbers emails from craigslist posts, and he had responded to many of them looking to meet up. I don't know what to do about this because I realize I shouldn't have seen his emails and because of this I don't want to admit that I violated his privacy. I'm at a total loss here on how to deal with it.
TL;DR:
