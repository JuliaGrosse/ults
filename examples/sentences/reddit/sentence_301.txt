SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me (23f) with ex (23m) and on the fence with whether or not to join him.
POST: We broke up in September and went NC for a month then from November-December we spent the holiday breaks together. During the time we weren't talking he took a girl to a wedding and on a couple of other dates. However, nothing came of the dates and she friend zoned him.

Now spring break is here and it's gonna be one big party. Everyone he knows, all week, in one house. He invited me in November.  Now just two weeks ago he informed me he invited the same chick from the wedding assuring me she friend zoned him and nothing is gonna happen between them. 

Now I didn't have a problem with it when he told me because we still aren't together so I can't be mad about other relations he is involved in.  I just lately have been rethinking it and I am starting to convince myself not to go. I don't know if I would be comfortable around someone I knew he tried to pursue.
TL;DR:
