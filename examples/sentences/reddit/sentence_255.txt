SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I'm (18M) literally at a loss. No idea what to do.
POST: So I've just come off a 3 year long depression back to being very social. I go out almost every day. I've been hanging out with this one old friend and just living the laid back stoner lifestyle all summer. A mutual friend of ours (female) is also in another friend group that I'm a part of and we've been spending a LOT of time together. We click amazingly well and there's never any awkward moments.

Here's where the trouble starts. Yesterday she asked me how I feel about her and it was established that we both dig each other. There are many complications, however. She has a weird relationship with her ex where he is still very into her and I honestly don't know if she's completely over him or not. He's also someone I see occasionally and would definitely hate me if anything progressed with me and this girl. 

She also said she isn't necessarily trying to have a relationship, but I think she said that just to not scare me away because before she had been heavily making light of the fact that she wants a boyfriend. This is the biggest source of confusion for me. I'm going to college in 1 month, and while her school is very close to mine (dating wouldn't be a problem) do I want a girlfriend in college? Does she?
TL;DR:
