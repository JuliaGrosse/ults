TITLE: Relationships [18 M] Poured heart out to ex [18 F] got rejected
POST: I dated a girl in highschool for 2 years but during those years I got kicked out of my house moved in with my sister and basically dropped out of school. When we started dating I would go to her house and stay till 4 in the morning and walk across town home but as I got kicked out and moved in with my sister I became more distanced and would ask her to come to my place. She would come willingly because she loved me but I barely went to her place after I moved and whenever she was over I would spend most of the time on the computer and she would wanna do things but I was too lazy. In the end I broke up with her because I thought I was happier without her its been about 3 months since then but we would text often and now I want to change my mistakes and get her back so last night I poured my heart out to her and she seemed unaffected by it and wanted me to stop because she's seeing someone but as far as she told me they're not even dating. Is there anything I can do or did I lose her forever? Sorry first real post and I hated English class
TL;DR:
