TITLE: I would rather be homeless than work. How do I motivate myself to work?
POST: Like the title says, I'd rather be homeless than work. Prepare yourselves; I'm going to sound like a huge whiner. I have a really good job, pays well, only work 4 days a week, awesome PTO and benefits, and I like my coworkers (with the exception of my boss, but I don't see him often) but I dread going. 

I'm not passionate about anything. I don't get excited about anything in life outside or inside of work. I've had over 20 jobs, and I'm fairly young. Never been fired, I just stop going, usually around the 6 month mark, sometimes earlier. I'm at the 6 month mark in my current position and think about quiting everyday. I call in a lot, but never seem to get in trouble for it. I do very little real work.

There's nothing I want to do with life, except travel, hike, and eat good food, and no one is paying for that. I'm lucky because I have a disability income of roughly $1500 a month from breaking my back and the following surgeries. Many days I think about just using that to live off of and never working again, but I have a mortgage, debt, etc, (no kids, fortunately), so I know I wouldn't last long on that.

Anyway, what would you do in my situation?  Why do I hate/dread going to my awesome job so much? Why do I always quit after 6 months? How can I change my perspective and motivate myself to get up and go every day?
TL;DR:
