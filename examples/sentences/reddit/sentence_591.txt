TITLE: Me [31M] trying to deal with my girlfriend [30F] not wanting to go on vacations anywhere where other people have been before
POST: Advice of "find someone else" is not going to be helpful, seriously. 

My girlfriend and I have a long and great relationship. However, we're planning our first overseas vacation together and everything was going well until a few of her friends went on vacation to the same country we were planning on going to. 

She now steadfastly refuses to go anywhere that other people she knows have been, period. I've tried explaining that neither of us have ever been to those places, and that it's a new and fun experience for us, but that doesn't matter. She says she wants our trip to be unique and to make other people jealous at how awesome our trip was. 

She grew up in very humble beginnings so I'm a bit taken aback by the whole attitude about jealously. I've also tried to explain how it'll still be special for us together even if others have done it before, and that shouldn't matter, but "I know people that have been there so it isn't special." I tried to give the example of what if we were going to Paris and you knew people that had been to the Eiffel tower, the louvre, and everywhere else worth seeing and she said she wouldn't want to go anymore just because her trip would be a copy of others. Wtf??
TL;DR:
