TITLE: Fear of my son's mother attempting to change custody due to my relationship status. TN
POST: So I've just been awarded overnight visitation with my 6 year old son after his mother kept him away from me for two and a half years. We mediated earlier this year and we (my son and I) met twice a week for a couple hours a day to reestablish our relationship. To him it was like no time had passed, he grabbed my hand thay first day and said come on dad let's go play. I'm currently engaged to a woman that I was with before my son's mother decided to stop letting me see him. I'm afraid that now that he is staying overnight with me and I live with my fianc√©e, the she is gonna attempt to take me back to court to take away what I just managed to get back. Can she do this? Would I lose my visitation again?
TL;DR:
