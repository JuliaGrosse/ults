TITLE: Found out my fiance (32M) had a MFF threesome before he met me (25F) so why am I so upset over it?
POST: I'm from a fairly conservative background where I was taught that sex happens after marriage. My fiance on the other hand, can't remember the number of partners he had. Admittedly, it took me a while to accept that because I can't help but wish I was first, but I know that this all happened before I came into the picture.

I learned about the threesome from an ex who sent him an email. The subject heading and first line showed up on his phone and I saw it. I asked him about it and he said it had happened two years before he met me.

I feel like I got punched in the gut. I can't explain why because I know logically, this happened before me. What he did before me isn't something he can undo.

I think maybe I feel as if he has no firsts with me and he's experienced so much more. I have had no desire for a threesome before and now I feel like I HAVE to do the same. I'm wary about his ex emailing him about their experience from TWO YEARS ago. When I asked if I could see the email, I saw that this wasn't her first attempt at reaching him. He had been going through a tough time at work and they used to work together. She offered to "help" and said "Let me know if I can do anything" to which he replied "You can let us do another threesome."

I just feel sick to my stomach and I know I Should put my big girl panties on and get over it but I can't stop picturing him doing things he'll never do with me, like he's gotten a taste of something that I'll never match up to

Is there any words of advice for me? I know I'm acting completely foolish but I can't stop or bring this up to friends without them possibly judging him...
