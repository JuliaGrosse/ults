TITLE: My caterer/event planner is buying all my DIY (rave!)
POST: So my caterer is also an event planner who is expanding his business to do all inclusive weddings (not juts catering and day of coordination but decor/linens etc.). My mom used to be in the wedding industry (owned a shoe and halo design company that designed for Nina) and my dad owns a construction company and is also in the theater world so my wedding has a lot of (let's call them) unique DIY projects. We built a lemonade stand which will be there when guests arrive, a "general store" for our favors, we collected 175 vintage mismatched plates, build a giant arch to get married under, took old doors and built an entrance for our outdoor ceremony, created a giant jenga game along with some other not so typical wedding projects. Our caterer saw them all (he is storing them until the wedding for us) and he asked to purchase them after the wedding! He offered us almost triple the money of what they cost  build/collect (he knows this we're not scamming him). He also offered my mom and I a planning gig when we are done with mine so that we can continue to help plan for others (I work full time 2.5 hours away but my mom is super excited to make extra cash continuing in the planning fun). I am so excited!
