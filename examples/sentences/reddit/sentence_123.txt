TITLE: [20/M] feels that relationship with [19/F] is falling apart.
POST: I have known my current girlfriend for almost two years (as coworkers), on a personal level (friends, dating) for 7 months and officially in a relationship for 2 weeks. She is an amazing girl and I truly care for her. However lately all I have been receiving is one word responses in texting, all plans being canceled, and talks about how another guy (whom she has only known for a few months) is always there for her whenever she needs somebody. She is going through some problems with her family and I have been trying to keep that in mind but honestly she is making me feel like shit. I have gone out of my way to make sure she knows that she has someone who cares about her and it seems like she is going out of her way to make sure I know that she doesn't care about me. I have tried to talk to her about it but all I get in response is her telling me I'm making this into too big of a deal and that I am being immature about all of this and that she doesn't want me adding on any extra stress. Tonight has been a low point where she told me that she is pushing me away and even went as far as remove any trace of our relationship from Facebook (stupid I know but the effort was still intentional). 
I have no idea what to do or how to talk to her about it because every time we do she always tries to pin blame on me and I have to even go as far as apologizing for bringing it up just to get her to stop arguing. 
Please help reddit, I really care about this girl but it seems like she could care less about whether or not I am in her life at this point.
TL;DR:
