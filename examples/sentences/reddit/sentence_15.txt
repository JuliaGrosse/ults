SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [17 M] with my girlfriend [17 F] of almost 7 months, best friends since 2012. Posting pictures many think are inappropriate.
POST: I am male and have been dating a female for 6 months going on 7 here soon. Do you think its unreasonable to not allow my girlfriend to post pictures of her thighs and hips in her underwear or a picture of her upper body in just a bra on an Instagram account with 110 active followers? She thinks of it as her body and she should be allowed to do whatever she wants with it I.E. post pictures of herself where ever. I agree with that completely and all humans should be able to do things like that, I am very with her on that and am a very big humanitarian, but when two people are in a committed relationship I feel it is different however and it should be obvious that you shouldn't be posting pictures of that sort. The bottom line is that it makes me uncomfortable and frustrates me to no end. If I were to let it slide and have her keep it up there for say a couple weeks and i forgot, if I scrolled past it I would go mad and have her delete it. For some reason I think it is different if I am in the picture however, If we posted a picture both shirtless wearing pants and her wearing a bra I wouldn't think much of it because it shows that we are dating. What do you think? Explain.
TL;DR:
