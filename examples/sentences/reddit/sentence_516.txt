TITLE: [24/f] trying to be supportive of a friend [30/m] who's not the type to reach out for support.
POST: This is about a specific situation, but actually I struggle with this problem with any of my friends who are not the "reaching out" type.

So I'm the type of person who's very vocal when I'm having a rough time. I don't lie and my first impulse is to call a friend to tell them what happened. Sometimes I become over-reliant on others, but that's a problem for a different day.

Anyway, as such I struggle to identify with people who are "not the type to reach out" when feeling bad. I understand that sometimes these people just need time to process what has happened to them, and so they are in some sense asking for space that you should give them.

BUT, I also find that these type tends to assume that you can read their minds and just know when they *really* want you to ask questions and support them... but they will never come right out and say it and would never dream of picking up the phone and saying "help, I need you," no matter how badly they may actually need you.

So, how do you balance giving someone their needed space with also showing that you are there for them? (I know there's always the "I'm here if you need me" line, but I'm also aware that this type of person will almost never reach out and take you up on that, no matter how sincerely you mean it, even if they want you to be there for them.)
TL;DR:
