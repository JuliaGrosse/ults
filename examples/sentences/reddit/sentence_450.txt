SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: r/relationships, what should I [21/F] know or think about before making the final decision to move in with my boyfriend [21/M]?
POST: So, me and my boyfriend have been dating for 4 years now, and are currently seniors in college (graduation is in May). I am moving back to our hometown where he currently lives (I live about 30 minutes away at a larger university) to go to graduate school. We talked about moving in together when I come back, but I haven't made a decision yet just because I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.

I know that, one thing that bothers me the most is his lack of cleanliness. I mean his house seriously smells, and always looks like it has been hit by a tornado of mess. It's bad. I never get too upset about it or nag him to clean it too much simply because I don't live there, it's his shit, and I'm letting him enjoy is weird foul bachelor frog pad for the time being. I'm just worried that when I move in, he will want to continue living like that and I'm going to turn into his maid...

Anyhow, there are lots of other things. I really just want to hear your experiences, maybe there's something I should consider that I haven't yet?

Thanks <3
