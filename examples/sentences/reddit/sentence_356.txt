TITLE: any advice? Friends With Benefits.
POST: So I'm a female (22) and I've been talking to a male (21) for a few months, we have mostly been flirty friends, and for a long time before we kissed or anything we used to text from the time we woke up until the time we went to bed everyday. But it was always kind of implied that we were more than just friends but there were no restrictions and we could/did see other people. Well I've stayed over at his house a few times and vice versa in the past few months, and we maybe talk online 2-3 times a week, just catching up or saying silly things to each other, but nothing else. A few days after the first time we made out he let me know that he didn't want a relationship, which at the time, really hurt my feelings, but now I've realized I don't want to be in a relationship with him either. We have only hooked up a few times, probably 4 times, in the last 2.5 months we have been in the same city.

Why is this so infrequent? Are we just friends who have hooked up? are we friends with benefits? I feel strange contacting him first, but I really want the hookups to be more frequent. I don't know if it's even worth my time.
TL;DR:
