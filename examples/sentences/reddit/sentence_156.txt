TITLE: Is she [21] playing hard to get or uninterested in me?[22/M]
POST: Hey guys first post here. So I'll try to make this quick, I've been out of the dating scene for a few years now and need advice with a girl i currently like. 

Her and I met in class and have been talking for not too long a month or so. We have tons in common I have gotten her number and we text every now and then (more on that later.) But I have really I've made the most progress in the past week. So everything explained further takes place in a span of a week. 

I've hung out with her a few times. The times we have hung out have been good we seem to hit it off. She's kinda touchy and takes lots of pictures of us (bff on sc if that means anything.) She said things like I'm special for getting to see her act in her goofy way. She even made and brought me a sandwich for when we were studying together. But ever since then she seems less interested in me and we do not text as often. Which is weird cuz that was to me at least the time we hit it off the most.  Before We had been texting all day but now barely at all and remember this is all in a span of less than a week. 

Most recently we were supposed to hangout but she said she forgot (which is a big red flag I know) but we did reschedule for another specific day. 
So is she uninterested? Playing hard to get? Or other?
TL;DR:
