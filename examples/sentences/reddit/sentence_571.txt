TITLE: Girl [17F] from school recently started contacting me [18M]. Does she like me? How do I deal with this?
POST: So the story goes like this: 
I've known this girl since 7th grade. At first we were in the same class, later we only had some courses together. We weren't super close, but we talked occasionally and sometimes hung out together, mostly with other people around. 
She usually is pretty shy and in no way did I ever get the impression that she was romantically interested in me or anyone else for that matter.

Last week we both graduated. Since then I haven't really seen her, but she started texting me almost every day, asking me how I am doing, what I am doing over the Summer, jokingly inviting herself over to my place, yaddi-yadda. All of this came extremely unexpectedly for me.

I believe it's rather obvious she seems to have a crush on me or something, but she hasn't explicitly asked me on a date yet. I think she's nice and all, but never really thought about her that way. How do I deal with this?
TL;DR:
