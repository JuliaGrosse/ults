TITLE: Condescending blood bank keeps calling me to go to blood drives all over the area. Will they take me off their call list if I lie and tell them I'm gay?
POST: I'm a busy person, and don't have time to drive 30 miles to a certain blood drive on a certain day with an appointment at a certain quarter-hour in an area I'm not familiar with.  I'm capable of showing up and donating blood at my own, and I've told them like 10 times over the past two years to leave me alone.  They get a condescending guilt trip attitude, like, "You don't want to help people in need?".

How did they get my info in the first place?  Because I donated on my own at a benefit drive, and a few times since then, on my own.  Now, every single phone call starts with a 20 second script thanking me for helping in the past.  Then they start going over my record.

I thought about telling a lie, saying that I'm gay, and maybe then they'll take me off their list.  But then, I might be banned from donating ever again since they might add that to my record, or even share it with other agencies.  While I don't like being goaded into donating, I do enjoy donating when I can.
TL;DR:
