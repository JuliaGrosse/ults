SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [M/19] am gonna be meeting up with my ex [F/17] in a couple of weeks about maybe getting back together - how to approach it?
POST: We dated for about a year, getting together while we were both in sixth form (UK, not sure of the US equivalent) and I broke it off a couple of months after leaving for university (I live away from home, about a 3 hour drive) pretty selfishly as I wanted to experience the life of a single lad at uni. After enjoying myself for a bit, I realised how much I missed her and took her for granted, you know the little things like having somebody to talk to all of the time, somebody to depend on and her in general. I isolated myself from all of my friends and eventually became depressed about the situation as I discovered she had practically wiped any existence that we even knew eachother.

Then, out of nowhere we suddenly begin texting again, leaving me completely and utterly confused about where I stand with her. To make sure I didn't end up becoming depressed again, I made my feelings absolutely clear that I wanted her back and essentially issued her an ultimatum, to which she responded saying she knew what I was going through but claims a lot has happened and that I need to understand that she "isn't saying no".

I come home for a couple of weeks at the end of March and she wants to meet up and see what happens.
TL;DR:
