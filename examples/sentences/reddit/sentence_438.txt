SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I am [21M] am wondering what to do about contacting a [22 F] who regave me her number before going out of State for the remainder of this Summer
POST: R/relationships a couple weeks ago a 22 year old college student from one of my Summer classes moved back to her homestate for the remainder of Summer who I talked to alot. We had great conversations and I asked her to get Coffee on the last day of classes in which see said yes and regave me her number during that time without me asking (my phone was stolen after the first time and then I got a new one). Unfortunately the Thursday before this past Thursday, I texted her asking her how her 4of July was around 10:30 in the morning and she never responded. Though this may sound optimistic I feel that she actually didn't even get my text because this happened one other time during the Summer session when I asked her a hw question. Do you think I should just let it go or attempt to contact her at a later time in the day and this or the upcoming week? Thanks.
TL;DR:
