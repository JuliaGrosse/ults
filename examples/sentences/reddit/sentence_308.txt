TITLE: I (22/m) have a wonderful (23/f) room mate, but I can't be myself around her because of her (23/m) boyfriend. Am I being silly?
POST: I (22/m) just naturally get along *too* well with my (23/f) room mate whenever I act like myself. We're just two people who have a lot of chemistry and really understand each other. On the very rare occasions I act like myself around her I make her laugh super easily, and get tons of reactions like "Uhh, I know!!!" or "I can't believe you think that too, no one ever thinks that!!!". I don't try to get these reactions, it's already naturally there. While she and I would never do anything inappropriate in regards to her 1 year long-distance relationship (23/m), I worry that when I'm myself there's just a lot of natural attraction that builds up pretty quick and I try to get rid of it.

When this starts happening, I always start talking about how cute some other girl I couldn't care less about is, I'll become a bit less friendly, a bit (fake) shy where I mostly avoid eye contact, and I'll purposely pretend not to be on the same page as her. Anyways, I'm worried that if I don't keep parading this *visage* around her, we're going to end up seriously attracted to each other, even if neither of us would ever act on it by respecting her current relationship. I would love to just be myself around her, but am I doing the right thing by pretending like this Reddit? Thank you in advance for your help.
