TITLE: I'm conflicted between my social life and my fitness
POST: I leave for college in about 4 weeks, (I live in California now and I'll be out in Colorado) and I'm having trouble deciding whether to go to my martial arts classes (muay thai) that go from 7:00pm to 10:00pm, or hang out with my friends who I won't see for the next couple months.  Normally I could balance both out during school, because I could go to the gym and no one would be doing anything that night.  But now since it's summer most plans happen around 7 and I find myself free only once everyone has gone home.  I love being around my friends but I also love the feeling of working out and I have a lot of fun during the classes as well.  I'd really appreciate some outside opinions.
TL;DR:
