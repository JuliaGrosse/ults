TITLE: I 28f want to leave my husband 34m because he's emotionally abusive, how do other people gather the courage to do stuff like this?
POST: Hello everyone, 

I've been married to him for 10 years now, he's the only relationship I've ever had. I've only lived with him and my family back home who I left him for. I'm tired of the emotional abuse he dishes out an don't know how much more I can take.

But, I'm having a hard time actually doing it. How do I just up and leave him? All of this time, plans, savings we've managed to scrounge together. I mean, at 19 I had no problem ditching my family who quite frankly don't deserve what I did to them. They were the best parents I could ask for and I just left them and my siblings. I even lied to their faces! How was that so easy and this so hard? 

I've wasted the best years of my life on this guy, missed out on so many milestones back home, time I could have had with my brother who just over a couple years ago overdosed on heroine. I could have already been done college but no, he said I shouldn't go to college an here I am. I'm so lost and confused and I don't know who to open up too, I can't even get a therapist because he thinks they are a waste of time and money.
TL;DR:
