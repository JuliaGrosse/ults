TITLE: Me [24M] and my girlfriend [25F] broke up recently out of the blue, she asked to brake up but was really distraught about it... What happened?
POST: We've been dating for 4 months and we had some drama in the beginning (ex tried to intimidate her), but during our last month together everything was good. Then on a Friday after work she comes home and when I go to kiss her she stops me and says: I've been praying and I can't shake this feeling, I feel that God is telling me to call this relationship off". She was crying, we hugged and we kissed each other's foreheads telling each other we loved each other. She asked me not to call her or text her because it would make the break up impossible for her. She grabbed her stuff and left noticeably sad (as if she got dumped). I begged her to stay... I really do care about her... What happened? Should I go after her? Or should I let her be?
TL;DR:
