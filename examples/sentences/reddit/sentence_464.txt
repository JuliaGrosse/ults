TITLE: I [20F] am thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend [20M] of almost two years.
POST: My SO is my best friend. I wish I could ask him for his advice, because I value his opinion and he's thorough in his thought processes. For obvious reasons, I can't ask him. So I'm hoping maybe you guys might be able to help.

My boyfriend and I started dating at the end of senior year of high school, and have made it through 1.5 years of college long distance. Along the way, we have had some major fights, but I have never wanted to break up with him for a number of reasons. Most importantly, I really loved him. I think I was also afraid to break up with him, because I knew it would hurt both of us a lot, and because I rely on him and he relies on me. We are very compatible in many ways. In a nutshell, he's kind, intelligent, ambitious, funny, and thoughtful. He loves me deeply, and so do his parents and his sibling. My parents are less enthusiastic about him. They think he's a great person, but they fear he might not be the perfect match for me. He's pretty quiet and introverted (I am too), but they fear I might do better with a partner who makes social situations less anxiety-inducing for me (aka, someone who is a bit more talkative with strangers). They also worry I haven't had the opportunity to discover what true compatibility is, because he's my first real boyfriend.

Recently, I've started to share their concerns. In some ways, it is the-grass-is-greener syndrome. But I think it also is a truly valid concern that he's my first boyfriend and I can't necessarily judge whether someone is a perfect match for me. I know he makes me feel comfortable and we get along really well, but I haven't felt passionate about him in a while. I also can imagine my life without him. I'm not sure if that's just because we haven't seen each other in a while, or if I'm ready to move on. I can't tell if I've fallen out of love or not.
TL;DR:
