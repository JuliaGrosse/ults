TITLE: Best domestic credit card for airline points?
POST: I have 4 to 6 flights coming up in the next year and a half from the mid-atlantic region to the western USA and Alaska. I'm looking for a good credit card that I can use as an alternative to my debit card (paying off the balance in full every month) to earn airline points to make all this travel a little bit more affordable, but I'm totally overwhelmed and confused by the amount of information my research has turned up. 

Additional information: 

I'll have $600-1,000 of normal expenses each month (depending on the month) that I'm planning on using the card for. This does not take into account flights or travel expenses, which will also go on this card. 

In addition to flights, I'll have rental cards and a considerable amount of gas to pay for (I'm driving from the east coast to Idaho at least once). 

Looking at my travel history over the past year, I don't tend to use a single airline. I usually mix and match flights to find whatever is cheapest. I have used Delta, United, and American airlines in the past year. 

Due to living in and flying to remote and low-population areas, preliminary research shows my flights will cost $700-900 each.
TL;DR:
