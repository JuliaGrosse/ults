TITLE: Hey Reddit, What Kind of Dog Should My Roommates and I Get?
POST: Here's the scoop: We live in a reasonably spacious apartment (for Brooklyn), a block away from a park. My one roommate will be taking official ownership/responsibility for the dog (meaning it's his dog, he takes it with him when we all no longer live together, and he will be the primary person responsible for feeding/cleaning/ect.) but we're all pretty excited about it and have gotten into a debate about what kind of breed we should get.

Criteria: 

**1.** We will be rescuing this dog.

**2.** It has to be small enough that we can carry it our arms/container (my roommate works in a pet-friendly office in manhattan, so it needs to be able to ride the subway with him).

**3.** It has to be big enough to not be completely useless/helpless. We live in a 5-story walk-up and we do not want to have to carry our dog up the stairs.

**4.** No hyper-active/super high energy dogs. We're looking for a four-legged 5th roommate.

So, any good suggestions out there?
TL;DR:
