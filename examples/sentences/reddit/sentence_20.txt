TITLE: How do I get/help my wife to femme it up a little?
POST: I love her and this is not, **repeat not**, a deal-breaker but I'd like her to be more feminine. She grew up basically feral, has no female relatives any less feral, and is too embarrassed to talk to her friends.
Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.
TL;DR:
