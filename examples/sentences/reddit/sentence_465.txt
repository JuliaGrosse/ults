TITLE: I [18m] get nervous around a girl [18f]. So much so that it'll take me 10 min to reply to a text.
POST: First off, we met at a week long get together, whatever, it's not that important. We just saw each other for the last 2 days of it. Also,  I am what I consider to be confident and outgoing. I have never had issues talking to pretty girls, just was never a problem.

 It started with us just talking. She is really shy, to the point where she would text me to have me come by and hang out with her and her friends and not talk to me but give me quick glances. I know she liked me because when everyone went to sleep, she and I texted each other for about 3 hours. I'm not really nervous yet in the story, so it's going pretty well.

After the get together is over and we all leave, she starts to text me on the way home (neither of us are driving). I begin to get a little nervous. I'm saying bland and boring things, not being my normal, outgoing, confident self. She begins to give me short one word responses, almost like she doesn't want to talk.

The next day I give her a good morning text. It's the same deal. Short one word responses. I am taking way too long to respond, just unusually boring things coming from me. Later on, she just flat out stops texting me back. It's been a whole day and no response. I haven't texted her again, and was just kind of waiting. I don't know what to do. I just get really nervous, butterfly's in my stomach, and tongue tied when talk to her. I think I really like her but I've never felt so nervous talking to another person, so I'm not sure how I feel. Help?
