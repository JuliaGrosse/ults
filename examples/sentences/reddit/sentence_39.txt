TITLE: Tried something new, not sure how it went.(M20)(F20)
POST: Told my real close friend that I am into her, and not sure how she has taken it, me and her have been real close for a while, but unfortunately she has a boyfriend, who she hasn't been on best terms with recently, but they seem to be getting on again. So I told her after I left her place, and from what I know, if girls aren't interested they will usually tell you right away, and let you down easy, or just completely destroy you, neither has happened.

She just hasn't replied, at all, nothing, I let her know roughly 24 hours ago and still nothing, so anyone got any idea to what might be going on? The only thing I can think of is that shes just consolidating herself about what to do next, like choosing what guy, but that's just me being stupidly hopeful.

Any idea?
