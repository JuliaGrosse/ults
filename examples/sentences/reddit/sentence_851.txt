TITLE: Me [19F] with guy [21M], first date in 4 years, I'm freaking out
POST: Hi all. So, I know 4 years doesn't sound like that long, especially at my age. But I was sexually harassed for the first time at 14, and then again at 15, and then had more severe issues at 16 with a guy taking advantage of me. I have received counseling, but I struggled- and still struggle- with trusting men. I would say that by societal standards, I'd be considered objectively attractive, so I get asked out and approached a lot, but I've never really been comfortable saying yes until this particular guy. On top of all that, I have OCD. 

So I have my first date in four years, and I'm scared. I can't shake this irrational fear that something bad will happen to me, even though I like this guy quite a bit. Any advice or words of comfort or even helpful statistics? I'm a very logical person and statistics resonate with me, so if anyone has any that are relevant, that could help too.
TL;DR:
