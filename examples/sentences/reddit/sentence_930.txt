TITLE: Hey Reddit, Monday I start teaching piano at a private academy. I have no teaching experience, advice?
POST: An old friend of mine owns his own private music academy. He recently asked me if I wanted to be a teacher. I instantly said yes, and he said I was hired- no interview, no testing of my teaching or music skills. I took piano lessons from ages 9-15. I am 20 now, and play 5 instruments including the piano, guitar, bass, drums, and accordian. Other than 6 years of private piano lessons in my home, a couple of music fundamental classes in college, and experience in performing for small crowds, I have no experience in teaching kids how to play. I am extremely excited, but extremely nervous. I see the other teachers have music degrees, years of experience of performing at concerts and benefits. I feel very underqualified for my dream job. I get the curriculum tomorrow. The kids are around ages 7-12. I will be teaching about 4-6 at a time. I have a good knowledge of music theory and piano, but just lack the professional experience. Any suggestions?
TL;DR:
