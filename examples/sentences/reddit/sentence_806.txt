SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [25M] with my Wife [27F] of 4 years, accidentally stumbled upon her Reddit account and issues about her sexual history have come up....
POST: We've been married for 4 years and together for 7. We have a 3 year old.

Our sex life is pretty bad. We have sex 3 or 4 times a week and I get maybe 3 or 4 bjs a week. I'd like to double the first number and triple the second, but it wasn't like I was going to be mad at her for not wanting more. Equally important, our sex life is pretty bland. Maybe occasionally roleplaying or anal if she's drunk, but it's really vanilla. I've brought up doing bdsm and stuff and she's refused - I left it at that because I didn't want to push her into doing something she's uncomfortable with.

But then I found her Reddit account, and she's posted about  how she's done those exact same things she refuses to do with me with random fucking guys before we were together, and how she would blow one of her exes as often as possible....

Not going to lie, I'm really really angry. Apparently it's not about her not being comfortable with doing something, it's about her not wanting to do it with me. I was kind of a late bloomer and this is my only relationship ever, but she's had previous relationships. It's really hurtful she's taking these experiences away from me just because she got hers.

What can I do about it?
TL;DR:
