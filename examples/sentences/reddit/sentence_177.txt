TITLE: TIFU by forgetting my wallet.
POST: This afternoon I planned on meeting some friends at Chipotle for lunch. After I got in the car and was only a minute or two from home, I realized that I left my wallet on the counter at home and needed to turn back and get it. So I got in the next left turn lane to make a U-turn. I make this particular one quite often and since I'm in a small car its not too difficult. But somehow, with the pressure of oncoming traffic, I horrendously clip the curb with my front right tire. First I hear "CRRRR", and then "hisssssssssssssss", and then immediately see the "check tire pressure" warning pop up on the dash.   
  
Since I'm only a minute away from home, it's not too big of a deal to drive back and assess the damage. I found that there's like a quarter-sized tear in the side wall of the tire and it's obviously flat. So my brother and I get out the jack and spare tire and do a standard and easy tire change. So we get that done in about 20 minutes and I leave for Chipotle. I get there 30 minutes late, and my friends are done eating and basically just hanging out waiting for me.

After I get my food and go to pay, I realize that I never even got my wallet. I had to have my friend spot me.
TL;DR:
