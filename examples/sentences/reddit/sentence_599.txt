TITLE: Internationals working in the US: how do you save for retirement/invest money?
POST: It's always recommended to start saving/investing as early as possible, but what should I do if I'm not sure where I am going to be in 5, 10 years? I don't have a green card, and my employer won't sponsor it in the nearest future. I don't know if I move to another country in a couple of years or if they just kick me out of the US when my visa expires.

However, employer has a mandatory 403(b) retirement plan, where I can contribute up to 5% of my salary and the employer does 4% matching. The enrollment will start after 1 year anniversary of employment. They also have a supplemental retirement plans without matching.

Or do I start investing, buying stocks and stuff like that? I don't like the idea that my money just sit in my savings account and do nothing.

Thanks!
TL;DR:
