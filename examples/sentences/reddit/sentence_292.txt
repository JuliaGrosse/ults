TITLE: How do I [23/m] stop my gf [25/f] from having the same conflicts with me over and over again?
POST: We have been together for three and a half years now, and I have gotten very good at judging whether a conflict is worth it or not. The factors are my mood, her mood, and the topic itself, of course. When she starts talking about something, I immediately know if we can have a productive discussion about it or just a childish fight over mutliple days. Don't get me wrong here - the childish fights are not just because of her conflict behaviour, but also because of mine, the only difference is that I can predict it.
Now the problem is, she does not have that predicting ability, and she doesn't want to have because she just wants to talk about stuff when she thinks it's time for that. I have tried to stop her at many occasions, but I pretty much never succeeded, even though I explained everything I just mentioned here.
I tried things like "I don't think this is the right time to discuss this, can we please move it to some other time?", "I don't want to talk about this right now, if you can't drop it I will leave", and "we have completely discussed this topic multiple times, there is nothing new to add except more fighting, please leave me alone with it".
I don't know how to prevent us from having big unsolvable conflicts every couple of weeks, but I really want to, because the actual relationship between those times of conflict is actually great.
TL;DR:
