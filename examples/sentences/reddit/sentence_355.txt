TITLE: How do I explain my innocent situation that doesn't look innocent
POST: hello I have found myself in a bit of a pickle. A couple months ago I found myself talking to a girl who is a camwhore on a website. she tells me she's never done it and wants to give me a free show. I respectfully decline cause I have a girlfriend but i continue talking to this camwhore cause I'm honestly curious what her life is like in that buisness. I am nothing but proffesional with her. one day I end up letting her text me. But since then all she does is text me asking me to come watch her. I've bitched her out for this a few times. two nights ago she texted me and started a normal convo then said "so...you wanna have some fun? ;)" and I said no thanks. then yesterday I find out that My girlfriend went through my texts and saw that last exchange and wants to talk to me when she gets off of work in 3 hours. I have no idea what to tell her cause I highly doubt she will buy this. what should I say???
TL;DR:
