SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I[25 M] told my girlfriend[21 F] we should split. She cried, and I caved in and took her back. Now how shall we continue? [Relationship]
POST: [Previous Thread](

The thoughts of there being no spark in my R/S kept weighting in on my mind, leaving me thinking again and again: Is she the right one? As said, my gf is too accommodating, quiet and docile.

I went out on a simple dinner date with another girl(no touching), and I was blew away by how much fun we had, chatting and giggling and talking about every damn aspect of our lives! That's when I decided it's a big world out there, and I should start going out with someone who I can truly feel alive with.

Note that I do really, really like my gf. I care for her. I want to kiss her and hug her. But I find it hard to communicate at times due to how shy she is. Her lack of initiative and interests in life besides work is something I dislike. **I can see us dating happily for a year, but I cannot see myself marrying her 15 years down the road.** I decided to break up, because she deserves someone who can love her, not someone who decides to keep her around for a while, then toss her for someone better.

I took her to a park, and told her I felt we weren't compatible - that she is awesome and wonderful and caring, but I just wasn't the right man for her. She cried, and told me how important I was to her, and how disappointed she was that I was giving up in just a few short months. No matter how I degraded myself, told her of my family problems, of my nerdy interests, of my poor-paying job etc... **she insisted she didn't cared for any of those, and that she wanted me for who I was.**

Now, how the hell do you find someone like that?

She wanted another go at this relationship, and I caved. I told her we would work this out together and start anew.

I want to find a way to love her. To find the sparks with this woman. To know that I can be with her for life.

How do I begin?
TL;DR:
