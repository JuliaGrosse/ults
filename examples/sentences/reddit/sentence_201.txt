TITLE: Found out yesterday that my [21F] dad [66M] abused my mom [56F] before they split up
POST: Sorry, this might be long. 

What I Knew Before Yesterday:

My mother [24f at the time] got a job working for my dad [34m] at an architecture firm. He was married, but they started sleeping together. When my mother broke things off, she went to graduate school in Europe to get away from him. He followed her there, begged her to take him back, and left his wife for her. He had a temper and would sometimes scare her in fights. Ten years later, he starts sleeping with Julia and my parents split up while my mother is pregnant with me. 

What I Found Out Yesterday:

My mother did not leave my father just because he was cheating on her. She left him because he was starting to expand his emotional abuse into physical abuse. He hit her. He smashed plates during arguments. He broke his first girlfriend's jaw in an argument. Her animosity towards him growing up clicked into place; I always knew my dad was sort of an asshole, I didn't know he was a piece of shit.

I guess I don't know what to do with this information. As it is, I rarely talk to my dad and rarely visit him, not because of what he did to my mother, but because he's always been self- and work-centered with a painful lack of empathy. He didn't want anything to do with me or my brother until I was already 3. My only tie to him right now is that his current girlfriend, Amelia, manages my schizophrenic brother's [25M] legal, therapeutic, and life-problem issues. I don't know if it's worth burning my bridge with my father all the way down, even though this new information makes me want to hurt him. I don't know what to do. Probably see a therapist. But if there's any coping mechanisms any of you could offer, it wouldn't go unnoticed.
TL;DR:
