TITLE: My ex [M/23] of three weeks has blocked me [F/23], a week later unblocked me and then a week later again blocked me. We went out for 5 months. Why is he doing this?
POST: We've been broken up *officially* for about three weeks, he dumped me because of long distance.  Said he still loved me, maybe its true, I don't know.  First time he blocked me I told him to do it because I couldn't stop myself from talking to him.  A week later, he unblocks me.  A week later, he blocks me again.  

I don't know why, I haven't been tried to contact him since the first time he blocked me.  And we're not friends, so its not like I show up on his feed or can see that much on his profile. 

I mean if he just wanted to see my page and then block me right away, why did he wait a week?  Why block me again? I wasn't bugging him

Don't tell me I shouldn't care because he's my ex, because I do care, because I still love him and want to know why he's doing this. 

And yes, I'll own up to that I creep his page, what little I can see of it.  But I miss him.
TL;DR:
