TITLE: A few years ago, a last minute change in my normal routine narrowly saved me from being killed in a plane crash. Reddit, what are some instances when a last minute event or decision inadvertently saved your life?
POST: When I was fifteen, my family and I were visiting our lake house for a few days. The water sits about thirty yards away from my house, and every morning right after I would get up, I would go for a swim and sit out on the beach.

After I finished breakfast, I was about to walk down to the beach when I witnessed a single engine plane crash right in the exact spot my family and I always sit in on the beach, killing both of the occupants instantly.
