TITLE: My [21F] brother-in-law [16] keeps making rude comments toward me about my pregnancy.
POST: I think his mother might have told him that I am pregnant. I recently found out I'm pregnant and my fiance and I haven't told many people at all, but we did tell his mother. 

Today when he came home from school (he's 16), he asked my fiance if "this" is what he wanted from his life (referring to having a child, we already have a two year old daughter). 

Later on, my daughter ran into his room and I went after her. When I picked her up he asked my "why are you so fat?" And I told him that I only weigh 100 lbs. His response was "Well, you look fatter than usual." Obviously I don't, because I only weigh 100 lbs which is the same weight I've been for a long time, and I'm only a month or so pregnant. I'm definitely not getting any bigger yet. 

About ten minutes ago I went downstairs with my daughter, where my brother in law was playing music, and my daughter started dancing and being silly. Brother in law laughs at her dancing and says to me "Hey, don't have another kid because this one's retarded." 

I told my fiance about him calling me fat, but I haven't said anything so far about what kust happened and I'm not sure if I should. I want to of course, but I don't want my fiance to get too angry and then my brother in law start acting hostile toward me for "telling on him." These comments are making me uncomfortable especially considering this pregnancy has already caused problems between my fiance and his mother, because initially she wanted me to get an abortion and now she's saying she doesn't mind if I have the baby, but that I should get a "procedure" after I have it so that I don't have any more.
TL;DR:
