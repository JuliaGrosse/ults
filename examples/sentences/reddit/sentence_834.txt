TITLE: I[24M] stumbled upon diary of my GF [24 F] of 2 months, and read the last entry only. Seems she is still in love with her EX. What should I do?
POST: Starting of this year October, we both kicked off with a casual relationship and had an agreement to stay in "No commitment" mode and see how it develops. It has been going pretty smooth between us. We both like each other and are comfortable around each other. Lately, I started developing more than "No Commitment" kind of feelings towards her. She seems to also acknowledge this.

Few days back, before going to bed I found her diary just at the corner table and at First I did not know if its her personal diary or some kind of random notebook. So I started from the last page which was written last week. And what I found was that she wrote about her feelings for her ex-boyfriend. She broke up with him to have freedom and space ( that's what she told me). Now I just read this entry and closed the diary.

Suddenly this feeling of insecurity creeped in and she could see from my face that something was now right with me. So I confronted her and told her that I read the last entry. Her reaction was also like "Damn!! but whatever, now you know even more. " 

At first place, I should not read her personal stuff and specially not violate her personal space. But then now I regret reading that and second since then, my head is pretty clouded with this insecurity " What if she catches up with her Ex and patches up?"

What should I do with the situation now? How can I make it right since she also has a doubt regarding me as iff I went through all her personal stuff. Reddit please help.
TL;DR:
