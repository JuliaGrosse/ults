TITLE: [30F] goes silent after successful 3rd date; past trauma is clouding my[32M] judgment.
POST: I [32M] had a very successful third date with [30F]. I went over specifically to spend the night; had amazing sex. She seemed to really like me and vice versa. In the morning she took my hand on the way to and from breakfast, and we napped after. Later that day she texted me "you're pretty great," and I responded in kind.

A couple days later I noticed the conversational tone and the frequency of her texts were decreasing. Odd, but nothing to worry about, as she has a lot going on. I secured a fourth date with her.

The night before the date, after I had gone to bed, she texted to say a house guest was arriving earlier than expected, and that we'd have to postpone until she got him settled. Reading this filled me with dread, like I might not hear from her again--I can't explain why. Note that it doesn't matter to me if the house guest is a love interest of hers.

This is day 4 of not hearing from her.  I texted her yesterday to ask how things were going and got no response.

I'm a very resilient person.  In a few weeks this will be just a blip on the radar, but because of personal experiences (last girlfriend died; woman in question is not aware of this), this is pretty painful for me, and this pain is clouding my ability to think rationally, or put myself in her shoes, or see how not a big deal this is.

Please help me understand.
