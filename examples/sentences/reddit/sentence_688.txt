SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Reconnected with an Ex-GF of mine after 5 years.
POST: So, when I was 22 years old I met a foreign exchange student who was from Ukraine. She came to the States to work for the summer and get some job experience overseas, something her college encouraged doing I suppose.

 Regardless, I liked her, she liked me and we hit it off. She eventually left to go back to Ukraine 3 months later, and we continued to talk but at some point she never replied back to me. I got the hint and did my best to let her go, as tough as it was. 

I'm not naive, I understand it was a summer fling and that it wasn't meant to last. However a few days ago, I was extremely melancholy  and I had a bit too much to drink as well. I signed into the email I used when she and I would write back and forth to each other and I read all the letters we wrote. 

This is the part I wanted to share, I sent her an email, now I didn't expect to get a reply of course. I was just melancholy about our relationship, and alcohol tends to make a man reminisce. 

 She replied. And basically said things along the lines that she was young and regrets hurting me. She realizes what she did and that I was her first love, her true love. That she wanted to continue to write to each other if that was OK with me, I haven't spoken to her in 5 years and I didn't expect to get a response from her.

 Now I'm opening up old wounds and I don't know how to handle this situation, I realize I brought this upon myself but what can I do? I certainly didn't expect this sort of response from her, if any at all. How should I handle this? I definitely still have feelings for her, but I am not a fool to assume anything could come of it.
TL;DR:
