TITLE: My [18 F] good friend [18 F] has gone and got the same tattoo design that I've wanted for years
POST: My friend in question and I have always been interested in getting tattoos, and over the past few years have had multiple discussions about ideas of what we would get. Throughout all of these, I have always said to her about one specific tattoo I have wanted and (still am) definitely going to get. It's quite a generic design, however it has a lot of personal meaning to me. 

A couple of days ago, with no warning whatsoever, she showed up with the exact same design on her index finger.

I was very surprised and quite upset, but when I communicated my feelings to her she got very annoyed.

 Her argument was that you cannot monopolise a tattoo, that it's a rather common design and that regardless of appearance tattoos have different meanings for everyone. I fully understand that, however I feel that there are an infinite number of other designs you could get to express yourself. Furthermore, even if she was absolutely dead set on this one that she could've had the respect to tell me, knowing how long I've wanted this for and how much meaning it has to me? 

I realise that there is nothing I can do now, considering that it's permanently on her skin, but do I have any right to be upset/annoyed?
TL;DR:
