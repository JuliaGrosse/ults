TITLE: Me [23M] with my girlfriend [23F] of 11 months, she keeps trying to discuss politics with me but I'm afraid if she finds out how conservative I am we'll break up.
POST: We like each other a lot. I'm not sure if I would go so far as to say I love her, but I can see that happening in the future. We are very compatible in many ways, but politically we couldn't be any more different. She is very liberal, and I am very conservative. It's just she doesn't know it (or at least I think she doesn't). I have tried as much as possible to avoid controversial topics or change subjects if she brings them up, but with politics being the news so much now, it's getting very hard, especially when she directly asks how I feel about X issue. 

In some cases, I'll share my views with friends or family, but I'm always careful. I don't see her as someone who could accept my views given how much I know they bother her. I'm afraid she would think I'm "intolerant" and "out of touch." I could be wrong, though. 

Part of me wonders if I should just be honest. Something else I've thought about is just telling her I don't want to discuss it. I'm not sure this would work because of how politically active she is. I know that every couple is different, but has anyone else ever had a similar problem? If so, how did you deal with it? Any help would be appreciated.
TL;DR:
