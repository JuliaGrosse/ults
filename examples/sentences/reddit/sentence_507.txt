TITLE: [NSFW] TIFU by forgetting to zip my fly...
POST: This actually just happened three hours ago, so let me type this out as I recover from the pain...

I was out and about with my girlfriend, and, bless her heart, but she sure can be clumsy sometimes...she always seems to be spilling water and the like when we're at restaurants, and it ALWAYS lands on me, without fail, while she remains completely intact. Now, this is no big deal by any means, so I usually let it slide. But not today...

I have this nasty habit of forgetting to zip up my shorts (I'm used to shorts with no fly, hence this) after taking a leak. So today, I was at a Mexican restaurant with my gf and went to the restroom. I came back, and everything seemed to be going well. That is, until my gf in one sweeping hand motion FLUNG her freshly hot coffee in my direction. That coffee, along with a bowl of hot chili that I was eating, landed straight onto my exposed Johnson. It was then that it hit me that I had forgotten to zip my fly one too many times.

At first, it didn't hit me that a molten combination of hot chili and coffee just landed square on my family jewels. But once it did, I was SCREAMING in pain...the whole restaurant was looking in our direction, as my hand was clutching my THROBBING beef bazooka...luckily, the World Cup was on, and many people dismissed this as my cheering for a team, but my gf saw what was happening, and she laughed really heartily...she, of course, was unscathed by the avalanche of lava that had just hit my beef bazooka...

Well, when I got home, I noticed that my slippery salami is now home to some nasty callous-like burn marks...it hurts to the touch, and I can't wear anything down there without it burning...shit...
TL;DR:
