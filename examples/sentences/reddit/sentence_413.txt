TITLE: [NSV] Hubby made me do his diet and I got tired of it.
POST: For 3 months I have been on a diet which is really quite strict, I basically start the day with some chicken breast and water and then an hour later I have rice cakes sometimes with low fat cheese. This diet was suggested to me by my husband who has lost a lot of weight from it and I guess it made sense to do it too.

I aim for 1000-1500 calories a day which has helped me shed a lot of weight so far, of course along with weight training and cardio. 

The only thing is that long term I couldn't see myself doing that diet. Although after 3 months I was happy with the results but I was really scared to change the diet in case I went wrong and all of my progress was reversed, especially with my 6month weigh in coming up. It kind of made me dread getting up in the morning because it was a drag eating steamed chicken breast every day. 

This might sound weird but after I saw one of those early morning infomercials for those blenders that "transform your life" I was inspired to try out a blender recipe. So I got on youtube and started looking for recipes and found a few vids that I have tried and are really nice. Been using them for 2 weeks now and they havent made me put on any unwanted weight.

SO I felt that I want to share my findings with you guys, maybe some will find them useful in some way if you are maybe bored with your weight loss diet as I was.

This one is the 1st video I tried:

 

I make this one in the morning basically drink half for breakfast and the other half before bed. It tastes really nice. 

This is the second one I tried, not as tasty but it did the job
TL;DR:
