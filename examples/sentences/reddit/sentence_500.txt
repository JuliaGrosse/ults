TITLE: Me [29 F] with my BF [30M] of 2 months, he has a 5 y/o son. I don't have kids and have never dated a guy with kids. How to proceed?
POST: So A and I have been seeing each other since May and things have slowly gotten more serious.  We get along really well and are both pretty laidback and seem to communicate with each other pretty well on things so far. He has a 5 year old son (B) who is absolutely adorable and fun to be around.  He has B one night a week and every other weekend right now, but is hoping to get full custody over the course of the next several months.  He seems like a great dad and B seems like a happy little kid.

I've had A and B over to watch kiddie movies and play in the pool, and it's been a blast.  I guess I just don't have much experience with kids - don't have any of my own (hope to eventually) and have never dated a guy with a kid.  I'm sure it will change the dynamic of things, especially if and when A gets full custody, and as A and I get more serious.  Aside from talking over any issues that may arise with A, any tips or unexpected adjustments I might have to make?  Anything I can do to make this arrangement/transition easier on all of us?

Any stories, advice, words of warning/wisdom/encouragement welcome.  Thanks!  Feel free to ask any questions of me as well.
TL;DR:
