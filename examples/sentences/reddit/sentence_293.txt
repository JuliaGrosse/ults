TITLE: I'm poor and need a car, my old car is unrepairable, and I think I was swindled. Please help
POST: To start, my car has about 180k miles on it. One day it started stalling because it couldn't idle. I took it to a local mechanic who told me I needed a new exhaust system installed for $1,500. He also ran a compression test and told me the motor was great. I paid him and it did not fix the problem, the car still stalled.

I took the car to a different mechanic. They deduced that the problem was in fact the motor, and that I would basically need another motor, which would be another $2,000 that I could not afford. They discovered this using a compression test as well.

So, I'm asking for advice about what I should do. I need a car, but have about 2k total left to my name, and my income is not good, and student loans. Do I have options to actually sue the first mechanic?

Otherwise, of the $1,500 I paid, $900 was for the exhaust part. Is there any way I can make this money back? Does anyone know of any resources to help me sell parts of my car that I could put towards getting another one? Thank you.
TL;DR:
