TITLE: Insane collections debt on my credit report that I've never heard about. Some creddit advice?
POST: About 4 few years ago I dropped out of a terrible private school, so they dropped all financial aid and gave me a lump sum debt of a few thousand dollars. My parents were going through hard times, and I couldn't pay much. So I sat on the debt unpaid for over a year, until I got a great job and was able to pay it off within 2 months.

At that time I also checked my credit score to see what's up. The school debt was "in danger of going to collections" at the date of paying it in full. A month after paying, it was closed and "paid" after paying it, so everything looked good. Debt-free for the first time since going to 2 different colleges, working a good job in the career I want and everything looking up.

Yesterday, I checked my credit report for the first time since then (~16 months). There's a debt I apparently owe to collections agency that I've never heard from in my life; no email, no phonecall, no letter, and all of my contact information is listed. The amount of the debt is almost twice as large as the original debt given after leaving the school. The kicker is, the collections was apparently reported to the agency a month before I paid the debt in full, but it did not appear on my credit report until months later, and of course I didn't see it until now.

The [website for the agency] makes me cringe, and there's very little information about them; though a search for the company name or phone number returns a lot of scam/fraud reports. Which makes me think it could be a fraud attempt, but the credit report says that the private school reported it. I suppose a scammer could figure that information out, but how does it appear on all 3 reports, and why didn't it show up when I was paying the debt?
TL;DR:
