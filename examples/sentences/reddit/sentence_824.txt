TITLE: I(m24) think my newish gf(24) only wants me for sex
POST: My gf(24) if she can be called that anymore have been together bf(24) for 4 months. I have been friends with her for atleast 14 years and only hooked up with her when we both confessed we have had crushes on each other. Dont get me wrong I love sex she is by far the best I've ever had but all she wants to do is have sex and when Im not around she doesnt seem to want to talk to me or return my texts/calls. Before we did it the first time, she was amazing she was always there for me always a shoulder to lean on. Now she rushes me off the phone or doesnt return my texts unless she knows I'm around long enough to take care of her. Now Ive told her that I dont mind being friends with benefits, but she needs to stop leading me on with saying that she loves me and doesnt want anyone else. Also she flips when I hang out with other girls but again never changes her ways. I really do love her and have always figured she would be the one for me even when we were just close friends, and goddam I enjoy the sex (shes fucking amazing and way out of my league in looks and ability). Basically I just need to know what should I do.
TL;DR:
