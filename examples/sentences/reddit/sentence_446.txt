TITLE: [22/m] Should I end my relationship?
POST: My Boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now and our relationship has been up and down. While we both get along very well, we also have a lot of qualities that are opposites and cause friction such as he likes for me to say I love you all the time, while I'd rather show love through actions. About a month ago we both graduated college and decided to move in together. Since graduating I've had a hard time saying goodbye to all that I achieved in college and an even harder time finding a full time job, because of this I have been feeling sad and disappointed in myself. I've been more quiet than normal and prefer to be alone. Naturally while in this situation I turn to him for comfort but rather find him telling me to suck it up, get over it and move on and that my behavior is making him want to break up with me. Whenever this happens, I always back down and tell him that I'm fine, just having a bad day and try to move on but I still feel that same way inside so I fall back into the same behavior. Two days ago, everything reached a boiling point, and we ended up in a shouting match with me calling him rude, selfish, and lacking any sense of empathy and him calling me pathetic for wanting him to comfort me. He once again said we should break up and left and is currently staying with a friend and we haven't talked since he left. I'm not sure if we should continue to be together or if there is a way we can work through this issue.
TL;DR:
