SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [19 M] interested in a friend [19 F] known for a couple of years, who says we probably wouldn't work out because her parents are racist.
POST: Honestly, this girl is amazing and so far shes already more of a interesting person, than my ex. I like everything about her, and I did confess but what confused me is, she never really rejected me based on her thoughts. She only said she things we could never be more than friends and if we did, become more her racist parents would be a problem. ( I am African American) she is (Trinidadian of Indian descent). 
The only issue I have with this is because she never told me what she thought about be besides saying a that I'm an awesome guy before saying the rest. 

It also confuses me because I know she is very much an independent woman and a free thinker, so I can't seem to picture her dating a specific type of guy so her parents wont  cause problems. Perhaps she has a weak spot for family and I understand.

So am I wasting my time? My best friend told me I should just take it slow (Kind of not focus on it) and see if any thing changes through out time and if not then just move on.

Even after that rejection we still talk perfectly fine as much as we did before.
TL;DR:
