TITLE: Finally, he (22/m) kissed me (24/f), now I want to feel that spark.
POST: This past weekend, a guy (22/m) I (24/f) have been friends with (and crushed on for months) finally kissed me (amongst other things), and we had that "I've wanted to do that since September" talk. So needless to say, I'm ecstatic.

However, due to past relationship blues, it is impossible for me to feel that giddy little spark when I'm with him.

About three years ago, my long-term boyfriend of four years broke up with me, and I didn't date for a long time cause I felt too numb. Since then though, I've had two other boyfriends whom I've felt just'meh' about, so I guess feeling that spark didn't mean much to me. But now, I crave to feel that little tickle in my tummy when he holds my hand, and that flutter when he looks at me. I know it's possible, because I have wanted this for so long, and he makes me happy. I know he is getting those feelings, he kept smiling from ear to ear every now and then. When I asked him what was up, he would just tell me he's happy.

I'm afraid I'm still numb, and I don't know how to get over it.

We didn't have sex, but we did fool around. And I get that "mmmmm" feeling when I think of what we did, but I want the romantic one.

This is also my first interracial, inter-cultural relationship. Maybe I'm scared? Nervous? Either way, I want to feel what I know I DO feel and CAN feel. 

Any suggestions on how to overcome this and start to fall in love again, in the proper way? With butterflies and shy looks and tingles? It's all I can think of. 

Thank you.
