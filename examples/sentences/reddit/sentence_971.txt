TITLE: If you had an infinite amount of time on your hands, what hobbies might you pick up?
POST: I am interested in a lot of things and can do many other things so I guess you can say I'm a 'Jack of all trades yet a master of none.' If money and time weren't an issue I would love to keep up with photography, crafting, and baking. I would keep up with music (I can play and sing) and I would learn how to play new instruments. I'd like to also keep up my love for helping people and exploring wildlife. If possible, I'd learn new things too such as how to snowboard, rock climbing (not on a wall in the gym), and even how to drive a race car (big fan of top gear and racing would be fun). To sum it up, I'd try to learn everything I possibly could.
