TITLE: How do I accept that my [28M] girlfriend [30] has an ex-husband?
POST: I know this is probably a pretty common question, but so far I haven't read anything that's helped me.

In short, my girlfriend of about 6 months has an ex-husband who she was married to for six years (they split up about three years ago). She had a kid with him and they share custody. I think the kid is great. Her and her ex are on somewhat good terms (mostly because they have to be because of said kid). The biggest problem is I think that I've basically ignored the fact that I now have to not only acknowledge that he exists, but he is going to play a part in her life. Forever. 

For instance, her kid's birthday party is coming up and he's going to be there. I can't not go. I feel like I'm on the verge of having an anxiety attack every time I think about it.

I just want there to be some magic way that I can flip a switch in my brain, and not care anymore. I feel like now that the reality has hit that he's going to be around, I can't even see the word "marriage" or hear mention of the notion of having kids because it triggers a huge emotional response where all I can think of is "there's a guy out there that you're going to forever have to put up with that impregnated your girlfriend, and knows her better than you ever will".

Our relationship has seriously been pretty much perfect until this (she is one of the most caring and mature people I've met), and now I feel like everything's been upended. I've tried talking to her about it but I don't think any amount of explaining can get her to realize just how badly this is affecting me. And even worse, I know how silly it probably sounds. I want it to stop affecting me and make things go back to the way they were before but I don't know how to make that happen.

Can anyone offer some advice?
