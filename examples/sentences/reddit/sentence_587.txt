TITLE: I[17/M] broke up with my gf[16/F], and I regret it and want to be back with her.
POST: So I broke up with her because, at the time, I felt like I didn't really value our relationship since we hadn't spent that much time together recently, and we have already taken a one week break from each other during which I didn't miss her.

 When I broke up with her a week ago, I left the option on the table for us to get back together after volleyball season is over in a month, and she said maybe to that. But to be honest, I'm not sure if I can wait that long to ask her back out. What should I do?
