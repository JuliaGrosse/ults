TITLE: Fitness trackers and actual calorie consumption
POST: Like me, I think the majority of people seeking to lose weight have a larger issue with overeating than not moving enough.  It's the same old thing we always state and restate - it's easier to just not eat the 300 cals of cookies than jog for half an hour.

So why are so many people thinking a fitness tracker is going to help them lose weight?  Eating 2500 a day, and being keenly aware that you're burning 2500 a day is not going to change anything.

I tried it myself, and it didn't help *for me* - not without eating less - which I can do without a fitness tracker.

So here's the issue, and my question... Is there a fitness tracker that will alert and remind me on my wrist how many calories I have left to eat in the day? 

This information being always readily available with a tap or a swipe would highly drop the barrier to checking MFP (which I know is already low, but considering I'm struggling with this...).

So far, it seems fitness trackers simply only track an upward marching "calories burned so far".  Which is not THAT helpful for weight loss when diet is far more influential to the process.

I'm not an app developer, but it seems trivial to me to just make it an option/screen data point available on the tracker that just pulls from the app or MyFitnessPal.  It's ONE number, and everything else is already synced anyway.
TL;DR:
