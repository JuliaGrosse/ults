TITLE: Would You Write an Anonymous Letter About Your Secrets to a Perfectly Good Stranger to be Pieced Together for an Art Show?
POST: Redditors, I have an inquiry here of great meaning to me.  To give a few background notes, I am an art student who has an obsession with the unspoken aspects of our existence.  It has been the theme of my work (some performance pieces) and I would like it to be an exposition for my final show at the end of the year.  

I know that everyone has things, no matter how relegable they seem to PostSecret content, that they just can't tell other people.  Things about themselves, their thoughts, unexpressed hurt (or even the beauty they perceive in little things that they feel others would belittle them for even having thought it); anything.  I am asking if I could recruit the help of the Reddit community in the form of anonymous letters to me about these things.  I'm not sure how I would manage this yet, I'd suppose I'd have to get a P.O. Box or something of that sort.  But this is not PostScecret and I am not going to sort through them for the ones that are most marketable.  They will all be arranged together and hung as aspect of my final show.  (I would like to note that I do not attend an unknown institution, so it is not as if the things you write to me will be hanging in the unfrequented space of some tiny art school in a backwoods Nebraska town.  I would very much like it if I could have some feedback on how many would be interested in this.

Let me be the friend to your Charlie?  (if you get the reference)
TL;DR:
