TITLE: What do I[27f] do with the boxes of xmas presents amazon delivered from my ex[37m]?
POST: I left my abusive ex-boyfriend for the second and last time two months ago. I've gone no contact with him, don't associate with mutual friends who remained friends with him, and even stopped speaking with most of my family when they believed the lies he told them about my mental health and supported his attempts to have me involuntarily committed.

When I returned from my holiday trip yesterday there was a pile of amazon boxes waiting for me. All nicely wrapped with gift tags naming me and my immediate family, and a long letter saying no matter what happened or happens he will always consider us family and he hopes we'll celebrate next year. The gift tags on my boxes all had notes about how much he still loves me and wants us to be together again.

I've got no problem throwing away or donating the gifts he got for me. I haven't even opened them and don't want to. He left me with permanent physical injuries, he gets no future role in my life.

What do I do with the gifts he sent to my family? It feels wrong to not give them out, or to donate them without mentioning it at all. And how do I make it clear to him not to do this again? I want to say something to him about how inappropriate and manipulative it was. But I also think it would probably be better not to say anything at all. He did it to open a line of communication, right? I don't want him to think it worked.
TL;DR:
