TITLE: Me [28 F] with my BF [32 M] 2 years, he can't get over all my friends are still friends with my ex
POST: I have cut my ex out of my life, but we were together a long time and our worlds were merged. My current bf and I have been trying to work on his overprotectiveness and jealousy issues a lot which stems from fear of abandonment. He tries to convince me that my friends are no good, they don't have anything going for them, and that I am better off meeting people I look up to. He even said that because they didn't take my side he doesn't trust them to be there for me. 

The thing is, my friends are good people. They may be a bit passive, but would never put me in harms way. They respect me enough to not invite my ex and I to the same outings. I've tried making new friends, but BF was actively making sure that he got all the attention and guilt tripped me whenever I was out without him.

How do I tell him that I will not abandon all my friends based on the fact that they are still friends with my ex? I don't think this should be an issue in our relationship at all.
TL;DR:
