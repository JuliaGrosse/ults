TITLE: TIFU by trying to be polite.
POST: Ok so this happened when I was in school a 5 years ago when I was 15  but I only thought of it today. I had just finished swimming after school and was standing at my bus stop. Waiting for the bus with my earphones in listening to music. 

This disabled lady then comes to the bus stop and is standing there next to me, she can't see very well and is mentally disabled too. I had noticed her a few times before at the bus stop and she usually talked to one or two people there and the the bus driver too.

 So she turns to me and says something, I don't really hear all of what she says because I have my earphones in. So I take them out and I think I hear her say "Is the bus coming?"

To which I reply "No, I don't think so" and I smile. Then she gives me a sort of hurt look and the other people at the bus stop sort of look at me oddly. She then turns to someone else and asks "will you tell me when my bus is coming?"

I'm standing there while the guy says yes and I feel and look like the world's biggest knob.
TL;DR:
