TITLE: Me [25F] and [28M] got hot and heavy one night but I feel he pulling away from me? He is really "busy" or losing interest?
POST: I've been dating this guy for more than 2 months. We hit it off well and been taking things slowly. We see each other at least once a week and we communicate via text on a daily basis. He would text me in the morning, afternoon and before bedtime. It used to be a lot of texting but we calmed down to a decent "normal" amount. 

Last weekend, I came over to his place and we become intimate (no sex though). It was amazing to say the least. I thought it would have made us grown closer but after that I have been hearing from him less and less. 

He has told me he is busy with work, classes and moving into a new place. So yes, those are legit reasons to not be as responsive. However, it would take him 10+ hours just to get back to me and I would see him being active on social media. He would leave me hanging when we text, he no longer tells me goodnight, and he hasn't made any plans whatsoever with me. I even offered to help him with the move but he totally ignored it. BUT when he does text me, he apologizes for not getting back to me or he would tell me what he was doing and ask about my day...

We haven't had "the talk" yet and we didn't discuss any plans for Valentine's Day either. Is he slowly fading from me? Is he having second thoughts or should I just continue being patient with him with how "busy" he has gotten? -even if he has been just as busy before yet he still finds the time to communicate with me...
TL;DR:
