TITLE: My mom's dog was attacked by a bigger dog, and I almost shouted the other dog into pieces (Dovakhin?).  What are some things that you've done that surprised you (and possibly others that were around you)?
POST: Some context from my story:

My mom and I were arriving home when some woman was allowing her big dog (some kind of mastiff) to defacate all over our lawn.  As we pulled into the driveway, she realized she was going to have to clean up after herself, so she asks us for a bag (real nice that she was going to just let her dog shit all over our lawn until she saw us).

Somehow, one of my mom's dogs - a chihuahua - snuck out and into the front yard.  The two dogs went about their business, doing dog stuff to identify one another, when her dog began absolutely mauling my mom's.  Just beating it to all hell.

I had no idea what to do, so I just let reflexes and instincts kick in.  I just let loose this ridiculous formless shout, no real words, completely incoherent.  But the damn thing was so filled with rage that the two dogs, and the lady *and* my mom were completely shocked.  Her big dog just stopped completely and stared at me.  I walked over, picked up my mom's dog - it wasn't hurt... just shaken - and headed back into the house.

More than anything, I think I surprised myself.  That dog could have definitely messed me up, but I never thought twice.

The lady gave us her information in case my mom's dog was injured, but that was pretty much the end of that little altercation.
TL;DR:
