TITLE: Right Girlfriend, Wrong Place. What Should I Do?
POST: About two years ago I (24) met the love of my life (25) and decided to move to her country and learn her language.
Everything was amazing at first, as always, I was penniless and homeless, but her parents ( she lives at home still) took me in for a while, I eventually got my own place and got some work, although not much.

after a short while the rent was bogging me down, I was living off pasta or rice and the work I had was private teaching, so I had no colleagues, meaning no friends.

this went on for quite a while, up until around three months ago in fact, when I returned home for the first time to visit.
I was so happy seeing my family, seeing my friends, rock climbing and just generally enjoying life.

Now I'm back and am undecided if I want to stay here or not. I'm not happy living without friends, without a real job, back living in her parents house again.

But I feel like I wont be happy without her, we have built a relationship here and I don't want to throw away two years for nothing.

Advice?

I also want to point out that the country she lives in is around a 14 hour flight from the country I live in.. so I cant just visit home whenever, especially as I'm super fucking skint.
TL;DR:
