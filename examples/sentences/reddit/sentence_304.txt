TITLE: Me [16 M] with my crush [16 F] 2 months, I like her a lot but I don't know what to do.
POST: For the past 2 month I'm hanging out with a girl from my class. I never really had the chance to really know her in class. So when we started to hang out and I really got to know who she really is I fell in love with her. I personally think she is perfection and literally can't stop thinking about her, but she is really insecure and isn't feeling well mentally for some time. I already told the people I trust the most about my crush. Including a friend of hers. But this is the first time I have a crush on someone. Normally I'm a person who tries to avoid crushes. But there was just something special about her. Because this is the first time I don't know what to do with it. I tried to forget my feelings, but I just couldn't get over her. I was thinking about confessing so I just could move on, but that would feel like just giving up this bond. So i wanted to ask reddit. There might be some things I probably forgot to tell but I had to write this fast.
TL;DR:
