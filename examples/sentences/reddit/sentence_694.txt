TITLE: Need some networking advice... overambitious?
POST: Hi everyone, so I'm a first year at a large company with many different divisions. I'm currently trying to lateral into a different division and have met with a person who did a similar switch. He said he would ask his manager... which he did and then said they were currently working on winning some engagements and that they may have a need in the future. This was 2 weeks ago.

Fast forward to yesterday... met another two guys in the group at a random after-work event and they offered to meet with me and talk more about the group and everything. The first guy introduced me to them.

I also reached out to an alumni from my school doing similar work at a different firm (not trying to move, just informational), and he said he was good friends with the head of the group at my firm and would be happy to introduce me via email. I said that would be great, but I'm hesitant.

I'm worried that I'm coming across as trying too hard now. The only people I reached out to are the first guy for coffee and then the alumn, but I feel like meeting with too many people in the group and expressing an interest is being overambitious (even though I never even asked to get coffee/be introduced, except for the first guy).

Should I proceed with the meet-up with the head of the group?

Advice appreciated.
TL;DR:
