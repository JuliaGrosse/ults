TITLE: Thoughts of leaving girlfriend of 6 yrs...she's financially dependent on me & I'm worried about the outcome
POST: Throwaway account here...29 yrs old…Basically, my girlfriend of 6 yrs is financially dependent on me. I pretty much pay for everything (rent, food, bills, fun, her taxes). It's not that I mind paying for everything because I really don't. It's that I wish she was a more financially independent person (for her sake!). 

Recently, I have fallen for a someone else (she doesn't know). I wish I could understand why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling, but I just don't. I wish I could turn off the attraction & be happy with who I have. I haven't felt this way towards someone else in a very very long time. It's made me realize that I probably shouldn't be with my girlfriend anymore. It's only fair to be upfront & tell her how I'm feeling. However, I have no idea how she would be able to take care of herself. I still really love her, & I think she's a great person. I'm worried that in her financial state, she wouldn't fair too well on her own. I would offer to let her stay in our home (rented) & continue to pay the rent each month, but then I would have to move out & possibly be renting 2 places at the same time. I'm just really confused about all these circumstances that would involve us going our separate ways, & I certainly would hate to see her life in ruins due a decision that I would be making….really confused…
TL;DR:
