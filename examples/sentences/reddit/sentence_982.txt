SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [18 M] with my [18 F] of 14 months, she just told me she's been faking literally every orgasm. ever.
POST: Hi /r/relationships, this is a throwaway account.  
Everything between this girl and I have been pretty solid. We get along pretty well, and rarely have major disagreements. We agree on most political/religious issues.  
Last night, after we had dinner, she told me that she couldn't handle lying to my anymore. I had expected something a lot less serious, but that's when she hit me with the fact. "Every orgasm you think you've given me has been fake."  

She then went on to describe how, as a little kid, whenever she tried to hold in her pee, she'd squeeze her legs with her hand between her legs or something to get off. Ever since then, she told me that that's the only way she's ever been able to climax. In fact, she says that it only takes her several minutes to reach orgasm with this method, and that she can do it even without taking her underwear off.  

I felt really betrayed when I heard this, particularly about two things. Firstly, before this confession, she had told me that she had never masturbated before. Secondly, EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE WAS FAKE! I mean she even faked the vaginal contractions and the fluids coming out.  

When I asked her why she did it, she claimed that she didn't want to make me feel bad, and that "it wasn't like you were going to give me an orgasm anyways, so I faked it."  

Rather than saying something stupid and regretting it, I told her that I don't blame her or her situation, and that I needed some time to cool off. So, what the hell do I do now?
TL;DR:
