TITLE: What has been your worst experience at a K-Mart store? Here's mine.
POST: I don't care for their store much to begin with but due to location and selection I stop by once or twice month. I went looking for some hardware but didn't end up finding what I wanted. Took to browsing the aisles because I didn't want to have made a wasted trip.

$3 for a pair of training mitts/gloves (originally $26). I also spot a similar set of youth/adult boxing gloves for the same price. I double check the clearance tags to make sure I have the right items for the sale and take both boxes to check-out. This is where the fun begins.

Training mitts ring up no problem but when she rings up the gloves the total jumps to $28 instead of $6. I point this out and they call back a price check. Comes back over the radio that the price rung up is the correct price. I decline to buy the full priced gloves and just buy the mitts. After I finish my purchase I return to the aisle to double check the sale tags and they've been removed. I was pissed at this point but really, what could I do? Walked out with my purchase got a good deal and was cheated out of another.
TL;DR:
