TITLE: Should I [23/m] just be honest with my good friend [22/f] and tell her that I really like her?
POST: There's actually more to this story than the title suggests. About 2 years ago this girl, who has been a good friend of mine for a while at this moment, confessed to me. Even though we were getting along really well and I was quite sure I liked her too, I panicked, making a huge fool out of myself and probably hurting her feelings too. 

You see, relationships and/or commitment scare me. The thought of it alone makes me extremely uncomfortable.

We've had our time apart since but we eventually started hanging out again (same friends and all). Not sure if she still likes me but we still get along really well and make each other laugh quite often. I'm quite sure I really like this girl.

Just go for it, right? Well there's one more thing. For at least 2 years I'll be going to college in another country. I'm leaving in less than a year.

Should I just be honest with her? Could I even handle a long distance relationship with my fear of commitment? Is it even worth to try regardless of my feelings for this girl?
TL;DR:
