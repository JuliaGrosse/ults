TITLE: Me [17 M] with my Ex-GF [18 F] of 6 months, she says she wants to be with me and build with me, proceeds to ignore me.
POST: Okay, to start we were together for a short while last year and during that time it was great I really liked her and felt it was reciprocated.  During that time though I found out she was talking to other guys behind my back who were attempting to sway her away from me.  Eventually we broke up but remained somewhat close to the point where she would still come to be with her problems. (which was a lot)

 I cared about her a lot and I still do, recently she started at college and suddenly tells me that she wants to build with me and be with me for my success.  Although, I don't really believe her.  

Since the day I've met her she's blown me off I can't count how many times, takes an unnatural amount of time to text back, and ultimately ignores me to the point where I feel she doesn't care.  But the few times she does respond to me it's something that really makes it seem like she does care about me. Her actions towards me just leave me confused and feeling left out, I feel like I'm being lead on but I don't know.  I try to discuss it with her but she's generally distant and avoids it.  Just not sure what to do from here, just drop her completely or keep trying?
TL;DR:
