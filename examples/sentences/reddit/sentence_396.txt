So...my fin aid is currently cancelled for college and I went through an appeal. I wasn't able to finish some SAP policies because of my sexual assault(took my out of class, had to drop a class due to harassment) and I told my SO because I thought he had the right to know what was going on. He already knows about my assault.

Anyways, that was a week ago and it seems like he's dropped off the planet. He's told me everything is okay with us but his actions are stating otherwise. We haven't talked in a week and I understand he's busy and I understand I've been emotional lately but I don't know how to get through to him.
TL;DR:
