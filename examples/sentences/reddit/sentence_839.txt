TITLE: TIFU by not buying my girlfriend a valentine's day gift.
POST: Obviously not today but you get the idea. It's the first valentine's day I have spent with any body and I messed it up and now I'm afraid I'm going to lose my best friend and the person I love. I don't really know why it happened. I just wasn't really thinking I guess. I have known my girlfriend for just about 3 years now and been dating for almost a year. We have been best friends for pretty much the whole time we've known each other and I have loved her for a long time. She has done so much for me and I haven't done that much in return. It really hit how much it meant for her (her first valentine's day with someone as well) once it was all out there about how excited she really was for it and how let down she was. She had been hinting the moment the valentine stuff hit the shelves but I've been an idiot. I feel like an ass. This event brought to light, for me, just how bad at relationships I am. She told me that ours feels one sided. That made me realize some things. I realized I haven't shown her how much I really love and care about her. I've been avoiding doing what has to happen. Namely growing the hell up and stop making excuses for myself. I need to get a job so her and I can afford to get our own place so we can actually start our future together. I need to show her how much I care about her. I need to stop being afraid of doing the things I need to do to grow up. I am lucky, however, that she has given me a second chance. I have 1 chance to make it up and I'll be dammed if I don't do it. She is on here alot so maybe she'll see this. I know I've told you before, but I love you Sweet P, I mean it when I say I can't imagine a future with out you. I'm sorry.
