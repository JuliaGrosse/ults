SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Last night I (M/20) told my GF (18) of a year and a half that I'm worried her getting more tattoos might make her less attractive to me, now she's not talking to me. How badly did I fuck up?
POST: I love my girlfriend, more than anything, we're even planning on moving in togther this summer. She's been wanting to get all these big colorful tattoos ever since her 18th birthday, she's on her 3rd now. I don't like them, I'd much rather look at her beautiful skin than a bunch of drawings. I've never tried to stop her, I would never do that. I haven't been exactly supportive either though, I usually try to change the subject when she starts talking about any new pieces she wants to get. This happened last night until she called me out on it and hounded me to tell her why I'm not supportive of her getting them done. That's when it slipped out. All I got from her was a "Wow" before she got up and left. I didn't really think about how selfish and shallow that was of me to say until this morning. I really don't want us to break up over stupid tattoos, but I think I crossed the line last night. What can I do to fix this? Was it good I brought it up or should I have just kept my mouth shut?
TL;DR:
