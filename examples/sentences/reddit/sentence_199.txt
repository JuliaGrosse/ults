TITLE: Not sure what the point to live is. A lot of problems.
POST: I have had a very Rollercoaster like life. A lot of fun and good memories. Numerous health issues, broken hearts, and unsure thoughts of myself. I've never had a gf and pretty sure a lot of girls think I'm creepy. I dont know what I want to do with my life for a career or anything. I'm only 21. I also am a year from graduating college and I hate my major and don't want to finish. I'm a smart individual with a great memory, but my ability to literally live inside my head most of the time and not in the present affects my social and working skills. I also get periods of bad forgetfulness, where I can't remember how to do things or know things I should.  I have negative self-esteem. 

I'm only 21 and I've dealt with type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, severe cystic acne whole body that required accutane, and I'm certain I have a couple mental disorders like dyspraxia or ADHD.
My fine motor skills are a bit off. I literally fear working because I don't want to get one of my forgetful episodes and screw up at work. 

I've dealt with a lot of pain and hurt. Constantly being rejected on the dating scene and looking more likely that won't change anytime soon. I don't see a future for myself because I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm trapped in a major I dont want anymore. I'm scared to work or do anything significant because I don't want my problems to affect my work and screw up and make myself look stupid. I am on 3 different medications and might need 4. I constantly imagine myself as someone else in a different world. Don't like life right now. 
 
The only things that keep me happy are to hang with friends and watch sports.
