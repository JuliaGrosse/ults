TITLE: Me [29/F] with my cousin [37/F], how to deal with her?
POST: Hi, y'all.

My cousin and I were close once but she started demanding way too much from me and gets upset whenever I don't do what she wants. After spending a lot of time here, I realize she's a narcissist and so is her mom. It's always about her and what she wants. Never any consideration for my feelings.

Anyway, I was supposed to do day after Christmas shopping with her; picking her up and we drive around to different shops. She insisted on smoking in my brand new car that I just got in October. I told her I'd prefer not since I want to keep that as a nonsmoking car, whether if it's cigarettes or pot. Plus she has a tendency to drop the blunt, she burned a hole in my other car which is why I didn't want to smoke in the car at all. She wouldn't let it go even though I said she could smoke before we left, so that made me not want to go shopping with her. She texted me this Christmas Eve asking if we were still going and I said probably not since I wasn't feeling well, headache and the runs. Never heard back from her to this day. Last year wasn't fun because she rushed me telling me we had to leave because she's done at this store and kept telling me to stop buying so much because we wouldn't have enough room. Yea, while her cart was full and I was carrying a shopping basket. 

So since then I did a slow fade and I've noticed every time we see each other in person, she always says **"you never text me anymore", "I'm mad at you", etc.** My first response is to say "phone works both ways." But that sounds smart-assed. I end up shrugging my shoulders and say I'm busy with school, which is true.

We're having a birthday party tomorrow for my aunt, cousins mom and my cousin will be there and I KNOW she will say the same fucking thing again... So what is a good response without being a bitch about it?
TL;DR:
