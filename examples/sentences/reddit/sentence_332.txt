TITLE: Me [18] with my crush [16F] Should I delete her from Facebook?
POST: So I've had a crush on an exchange student in my school for the past 6 months. We never really talked that much but we had short conversations sometimes. Saying hi and such. I had a feeling she liked me becouse she kept liking my facebook pictures and statuses and when I saw her looking at me she quickly looked down. I just had this feeling. But for the past weeks she did not speak at all to me or look at me. So I said fuck it. If she doesnt show interest I wont either. So we began ignoring each other I guess. Suddenly yesterday she liked my picture again and today I found out she is going back to her country. She said goodbye to everyone in class except me while in the corridor... I'm so confused if she liked me or not... so I'm asking. Should I delete her facebook since I won't ever see her again anyways? Or should I type to her or something? I don't know...
TL;DR:
