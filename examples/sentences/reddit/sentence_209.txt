TITLE: Me [21/F] with my girlfriend [22/F]. 1 year together. Haven't been getting along lately but I want to fight for this relationship -- help?
POST: So my girlfriend "Kyla" and I have been together for about a year now. Our relationship has been great from the start, we always got along super well and had the best of times together. I often tell her she is me in a different body -- we complete each others' sentences and are very affectionate and in love. The sex is great, she's my best friend, everything's awesome. Or it had been, for the past 11 months or so.

Around a month ago I felt that we kind of reached a rough patch. We were fighting over silly things (well, not really fighting, more like having talks about it), one little thing she said would make me mad and vice versa. We always apologized and made up before going to sleep, but we still argued quite a bit.

I'm not sure what to do. Lately I've found myself wondering if I'd be happier if I was single. I love Kyla and she's my life, but there are days when I look at her and think that I'm not really that attracted to her anymore. And then that thought leaves just as fast as it came. So we have our great days, days where I'm head over heels for her, and then we have our off days, when I start to question why we're still together and if we should break up.

I'm not sure if this is because the honeymoon phase is finally over or what, but I don't want to give up on our relationship. I love this girl. I could see myself long-term with her, buying a house and getting a dog and everything. What can I do to make our relationship go back to what it was? Is there any hope? If I work at it, can I make these little fights stop or is it hopeless?

Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm kind of at a loss right now, she's the first person I've ever fallen in love with and I want to work through this rough patch really badly. Thank you.
TL;DR:
