TITLE: Best friend's family are fighting over everything. Known them for 13 years and I'm can't take it anymore.
POST: I've known my best friend since I was 5(13 years now) and his family for almost as long and I've spent a large amount of time with them and I really care about them.

I like to think they care about me as well, at least that's how I've understood it. However, they just can't stop fighting. 

I would say there's at least 3 fights on an average day and that's only the fights that I see before I leave, there's probably more.

Family consists of mom, dad, best friend(20), sister(16), brother(25ish). 

Overall, I feel awful when they're fighting around me especially since it's so painfully obvious how easy it would've been to avoid the fight altogether.

I know fighting with your parents at that age is normal and usually leads to the kids moving out, this has been going on forever and I feel like they will all have trouble communicating with other people in their life if they continue like this(Not to mention how fragile their family connection is right now)

Today after yet another meaningless fight, I decided I was done and gave them an ultimatum. I'm going to break all connections with them until they learn how to not fight. Starting with being able to spend a longer period of time without insulting eachother(Especially in unnecessary things. You don't have to insult someone to get them to do something they forgot)

I talked to them seperately about it and it feels like the sister has already given up and feels like it wont work anyway and that she's tried before and it's hard because they insult her all the time.

My best friend basically replied: "Okay then, it was fun having you as a friend all these years".
