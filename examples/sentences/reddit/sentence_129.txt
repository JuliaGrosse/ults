SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] of over a year, I broke up with her 4 days ago, feeling regret
POST: I won't try to make this too long. I was with a girl for about 16 months, and I'd say we had a pretty healthy relationship the whole time. I could tell she always gave 100% to the relationship and would have done anything for me. She is sweet, hot, funny, and very outgoing. 

About 10-12 months in, however, I couldn't help but feel like things just weren't connecting between us like they used to; I didn't feel the way I thought I SHOULD feel with such a great girl. Sometimes things with her would be great, but a lot of the time I would find myself wanting to be alone more than wanting to spend time with her--basically just plain disinterest. These thoughts would come and go until they came to a head last week. I decided it was best we end things. She told me she would have worked it out, but I didn't want to string her along when I was so confused with my feelings. 

We haven't spoken since. I realize it is only 4 days out, but I am terrified that ending such an overall great relationship without working through things was the worst decision of my life. I am conflicted between telling her how I feel now while there's still a chance for her to return, or waiting and possibly missing that chance. I can't tell if this is a case of the normal post-breakup regret, or if I just didn't know what I had until is was gone. 

Any input/stories of your experience with post-breakup regret would be much appreciated.
TL;DR:
