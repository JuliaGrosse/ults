TITLE: I just witnesses a passenger (woman) from a moving car (45mph) throw a handful of change at a cyclist; I called th cops and gave them the license and car info, but...
POST: The cops said that since I wasn't the one assaulted, there isn't anything they can do?!
I know where these people live bc of where they were turning and I want some kind of revenge for the poor guy almost lost his life last night (if this cyclist would have fallen, there is no doubt that I would have run him over). This was around midnight last night and I promised myself I would sleep on it before I made and rash decisions (I wanted to throw dog-shit at their car or key it with a little note about assaulting people from a car like cowards)...
Am I being childish for wanting to do something really vile to these ducks, or should I just let it go and hope jarma will take care of the rest?
TL;DR:
