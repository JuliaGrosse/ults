TITLE: NOT quite sure if me (29 F) and my boyfriend (24 M) have a future together. Anyone in a relationship Older woman / Younger man/ who can share their stories and advices?
POST: We have been together for almost 3 years now, and everything has been as perfect as it can be. We are perfect for each other and share a deep love.

But recently I've been worrying about the future. I've already lived abroad, studied a masters and lived by myself, but he hasnt'd done that yet, and I don't want him to lose the opportunity to do so.

Whenever I tell him that, he says that he doesn't matter for those things, and that cannot wait for us living together. I also worry that by when he wants to have babies I will no longer be able to do so.

It helps me a lot to read success stories about older women with a younger boyfriend or husband, gives me hope for the future
