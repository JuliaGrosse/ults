TITLE: My[17F] bf[7M] is getting braces and I'm wondering if it will take away from his appearance.
POST: My boyfriend is not 7, excuse my typo ha. 

So my boyfriend of roughly 6 months is getting braces in a couple of days, like I said, and I'm scared I'll find him less attractive. He doesn't have very crooked teeth as is and I really like his smile. He's already kind of dorky looking, in a way that I find extremely attractive ofc, so I think they'll enhance his dorkiness. I'm not gonna break up with him or anything if I think he looks weird. Just wondering if anyone else has felt that way? I know I'll probably just have to get used to him having them, he's probably going to have them for over a year. In addition, i know this can be an uncomfortable experience, what can I do to help him deal with the pain for the first few days? Is there anything I can buy him and stuff to make him feel better?
TL;DR:
