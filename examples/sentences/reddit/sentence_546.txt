TITLE: How do I (F19) start the process of moving out of my house?
POST: So I'll try to keep this simple. My freshman year of college my parents were going to pay for me to live on campus but I decided to stay home the first year in order to save money for the next year so I could live in an apartment. Well my parents went from complete support my freshman year to "we will help you out but you need to pay some of it" after the second semester of my freshman year, I was fine with that. Now I'm about to complete the first semester of my sophomore year and my parents told me that I have to completely support myself and that they WILL NOT be helping me at all. 

The problem is I have no boundaries in this house. I can't go out and do what I want without being questioned, I can't come and go as I please (like coming home at 3 A.M.) without being accused of doing immoral things or my dad getting angry. My parents are pretty religious so they think I'm out partying or doing things they don't agree with, which I might be but its still annoying to have to be lectured and I want to experience things in my life. I just want freedom and I understand the financial responsibility that comes with moving into an apartment but I already have someone I would like to move in with. I have a job that doesn't pay a ton but I have a second one I could pick up no problem. I'm just tired of being smothered.

So I guess my question is how do I start the moving out process like saving money or is there a loan I could take out to provide housing funds. Also I would like to hear about other people's experience moving out in college, how your life was different and if you would suggest me moving or toughing it out for a little bit.
TL;DR:
