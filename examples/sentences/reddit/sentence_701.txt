TITLE: Can someone take back something they gave to you as a gift?
POST: My uncle was staying with my grandfather for about a year.  He was slowly throwing away my grandfather's old things (television sets, bath towels, etc) and replacing them with new things he bought and gave to my grandfather as gifts.

He suddenly gathered up *everything* he ever purchased in my grandfather's house (even if it was a Christmas gift from 30+ years ago) and left with it.  My grandfather is in a tight spot now because he's missing a lot of items he's come to depend on.

One of my friends said that if something is given under the agreement of a gift and then it is taken back, that can be considered property theft.  I know so little about all this, but I can't help but feel it's wrong (at least on a moral level).  Is there any legal backing, or is my grandfather just out of luck for accepting gifts?
TL;DR:
