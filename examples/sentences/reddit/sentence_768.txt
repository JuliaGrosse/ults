SUBREDDIT: r/running
TITLE: I have a new found respect for new runners.
POST: So a little backstory: I ran all four years in high school and all 5 years in college at a nationally ranked D2 program. All in all I have run for 9 years never taking more than a month off a year. But, then I finished my eligibility for NCAA in April, and, quite frankly, I got lazy. I told myself I was going to take as much time off until I got "the itch" to run again. After 2 months, the itch came and I ran consistently for a week or two. Then, I took another 2 months off, maybe running once every two weeks (if that). So today I finally had enough of my laziness because I have been feeling depressed recently and I have attributed it to the fact I haven't been running, among other more deep-rooted issues. I went running this morning and struggled. 2 miles at an 8:30 pace, which earlier this year I would have considered a day off and not broken a sweat, nearly killed me. I finished my run and my heart rate was north of 180. Nearly passed out and threw up. 

Now you lovely people may be wondering... why is he telling us this? 
Well my comrades, if I did not know that with time this feeling of death would give way to a feeling of accomplishment and success, THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD EVER DECIDE TO START RUNNING. 
So I say to you, slightly over-weight human being starting out thinking " I am gonna die," you won't. It'll take some time, but it'll get better with consistency and progression. Just know that you are brave and far more courageous than me you beautiful bastard you. So keep putting one foot in front of the other.
TL;DR:
