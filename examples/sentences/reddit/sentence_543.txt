TITLE: My father [M75] let my dog run away and I'm [F22] pissed. How do I repair things?
POST: I just graduated from college and decided to celebrate by adopting a dog. He's a tiny Pomeranian mix who is extremely quiet and well-behaved. I've been spending a lot of time taking him on long walks, enrolling him in obedience classes, and overall bonding with him as much as possible. 

My dad wants nothing to do with my boy and is instead focused on our other two dogs. That's fine with me, since I can handle the responsibility. Until... Today. 

My dog is normally glued to my side and today was no exception. He was lying at my feet when I was busy working in the dining roon. My dad was making some noise by the front door and he jumped up to go see.

Well, my dad swung the door wide open and my baby ran outside. Rather than chasing him or calling him, my dad finished what he was doing and then came over to me. Our conversation went kinda like this-

Him- *"Oh by the way, your dog ran away."*

Me- *"Wait, WHAT? How did he get outside?"*

Him- *"I opened the door and he ran out. You're responsible for controlling your dog."*

Me- *"He was lying right next to me! Where did he go?"*

Him- *"I don't know, across the street, I think. He's your responsibility, not mine!"*

Long story short, I rushed outside and our neighbor was petting him across the street. Nothing bad happened, but it could've. We live on a busy street and it's not a safe environment for a loose dog.

I recognize that I should be watching him at all times, but I'm only human and it's inevitavle I'll get distracted. In the meantime, I feel like my family should be looking out for him to make sure he doesn't get hurt. I do all the feeding, walking, grooming, training and so forth, and I work from home so he's always with me. How do I set boundaries with my dad to ensure that my pet is safe?
TL;DR:
