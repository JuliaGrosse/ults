TITLE: Is it fair for my (29/f) girlfriend not want to move to my (31/m) area?
POST: My girlfriend and I had been together just a bit over a year. We are currently in a long distance relationship, but see each other pretty often thanks to my job that pay quite decently with lot of off time. 

She was supposed to move here 2015 summer after she finish college. 

Yesterday we were talking and she say that she may would have to stay another year or two to help her mom out with her two brothers (both high school age) and grandmother! 

I was upset about this! Her mom is more than capable of taking care of them but she simply doesn't want to be a mother any more! She have been trying to find someone to just dump them off at! My girlfriend somehow decided that she have to be like boys' second mother!

I pretty much told her that this is not fair to me. She just keep making excuses after excuses about everything then try to say we'll find a way to make it work!

Is this appropriate or fair?
TL;DR:
