SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My boyfriend's (27) sister (20) is narcissistic, annoying, and I can't make her go away for good. I'm going to lose my mind soon!
POST: I'm not going to go into major detail about everything, but basically over the years she has been causing me nothing but strife. 

She's loud, obnoxious, and attention seeking. She posts novels on Facebook about how she's so proud of herself for this and that. Like getting over anorexia. She never was anorexic. I saw her eat no problem whenever someone brought her food. The only problem was, she's too lazy to make her own food. That does t sound like anorexia to me. And she's still 100 lbs soaking wet. 

She also posted about how she is done with drinking and she needs to not do it as much, and not even 4 days later she posts a bunch of pictures, booze in hand. 

These are just a couple examples of how annoying as hell she is. Also, my boyfriend and I have gotten in fights with her, and she has called me fat (sorry I don't still wear children's sizes as an adult) and tried and failed to physically assault me. I'm the most non confrontational person ever. She's just crazy. 

So I've tried to just block her on everything and ignore her so she goes away. But then she lays guilt trips on her brother and I end up getting dragged back into it for the sake of peace. As the saying goes "the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb". But apparently she takes it as the usual way it's said. 

I don't want to associate with her, but I feel weird telling my bf I don't want him talking to her either. The problem is she is extremely manipulative. Do you think she actually has a mental disorder? She's unhygienic, never cleans her house, let's her dogs shit and piss all over the house and doesn't clean it. She does random drugs and drinks every 4 days. And she's constantly acting like some hardass on facebook.
TL;DR:
