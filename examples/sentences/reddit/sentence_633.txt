TITLE: I know there are plenty of IT folks hereabouts. Any advice for an aimless college student?
POST: Heya.

So, I'm a 24-year-old junior pursuing a BS in Info Systems. I started college late, wasted a couple years looking for a 'passion' that I never found, and jumped into IT for practical reasons.

I'm a bit aimless, and in need of some career direction/advice. I feel I need to focus and self-study a given field in order to have a chance of landing a job when I'm out in a year. 

I'd really appreciate any input on what field/job I should aim for. I have taken/am taking courses in several disciplines (networking, database, C++, Java, MIS, web programming, security, etc.), but I'm not excited about any of it; it's all mildly interesting. Hence, I'm more worried about job conditions than job interest. 

(Realistic?) characteristics of what I'm hoping for:

* I really like to be left alone. Half the reason I opted for IT was for the solitude (relative to other careers). I do data entry part-time now, and am isolated for 99% of the workday. It's perfect. Being left alone is extremely important to me.
* I don't care about being challenged/stimulated at work. Doing something rote and boring all day is fine by me, even preferable.
* $$$ is secondary. Mo' money is always good, but I won't be getting married/having kids/etc., so a lot of cash or opportunities for career advancement aren't necessary. I just need to be able to live comfortably alone. And I'm pretty cheap.
TL;DR:
