SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [23 M] and my girlfriend [23 F] of 1 month, decided to try build a relationship on honesty. But I can't tell if she's not or I'm just being paranoid.
POST: Some back story.

About a year ago I went on a couple of dates with my now girlfriend. I didn't want anything serious, at the time, so I kind of allowed it to fizzle out.

So she was a little pissed with me for leading her on, which is perfectly understandable. This summer we bumped into each other after some fairly major events had happened in my life, and I sincerely apologized to her, to which she told me that was all she needed to hear. So went on a couple dates again and I asked her to go out with me. To which she agreed! Hurrah!

In doing this we agreed that there was to be no more half-measures and beating around the bush type things and that we needed to be honest with each other completely. 

So I told her about the major life events that had happened me and some things from my past etc. etc. and it was all a big emotional conversation. 

So we've been going out for just over a month now and we had a big talk about sex. What we like, don't like, what we want all the basics. 

And it eventually came around to the topic of what our "Number" was. She asked me mine and I told her and then I asked her what hers was, to which she replied; "I can't remember". Which shocked me a little.

Now, in my mind, she either has genuinely had had so much drunken sex she can't remember. Or she just doesn't want to tell me because it's potentially very high and she's embarrassed perhaps. 

And the thing is I don't care either way, because we have been honest with each other up to this point. I am very happy. But it's more that she doesn't have a reason. She just can't remember. 

So what are people's opinions? Am I being paranoid or is there a potential cause for a lie? Thanks!
TL;DR:
