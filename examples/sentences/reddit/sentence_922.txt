SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Wondering if I am missing a subtext.
POST: Hey folks, throwaway account here as my social circle is very internet-savvy.

I am a vet 23[M] going to a university.  I am being lightly pursued by a fellow student, 20[F].

I do not know why.  She's not really in my social group, we see each other in passing(had one class together ages ago).  The few girls I was interested in shot me down (gently) so I've resigned myself to a mostly celibate college experience.  Therefore, I act in a genial manner to everyone but keep to myself at all times.

I'm worried I'm seeing something here because I want to see it.  I'm worried if I follow through I will be seen as a lecherous creep.

The only other relationship I've ever been in I broke off because I was ashamed I didn't have a car and the girl lived a couple towns over (and had to pick me up and drive me home).  Due to this, I haven't developed any sense of body language ques if a girl is fully interested or not.

I feel like I'm stumbling blind, and that if this girl who seems interested actually is, she'll be put off by my timidity.

For context purposes, I am extremely self-assured if I know the nature of my relationship with people.  That is why this is troubling for me, I don't know how she feels and I don't want to collapse the waveform by asking a question in a socially insensitive manner such that she feels uncomfortable and breaks what might be the first genuine human interaction I've had in 3+ years.

How do I proceed?  Should I ask her to accompany me on activities I normally perform myself (hiking, shooting, running)?  How do I formulate a litmus test sort of date where I know how she feels, whether this is a friendship attempt or a romantic gambit?

We've had dinner already, and I stumbled over my only compliment to her.
TL;DR:
