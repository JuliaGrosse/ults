SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I'm [m/21] going to hang out with a girl [20/f] who I had/have a crush on since High School..we were friends in HS, but I haven't seen her in a few years and I want things to go a different route.
POST: Hey reddit, so as the title says I've known this girl for a good number of years. We're both in college in the same city but different schools. I haven't seen her in about 3 years since HS, and I always had a big crush on her. We we're good friends in HS as I was an ugly pimply duckling. But I have now grown and do look a lot different (better wise). 

I recently texted her to hang out and she's responded willingly and wants to meet up to hang out. I don't want this to seem as I just want to be friends but I don't want to full on get on her either, just play it cool for now. So I'm more confident now conversation wise, and interesting wise but what subjects should I avoid that seem "friend zone" friendly, and what should I avoid that says let's be friends.

I haven't been single in about two and a half years and have been alone for about two months now so i'm pretty new to this game. Thanks for all yer help!
TL;DR:
