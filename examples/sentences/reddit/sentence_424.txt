TITLE: Cat stressed out by moving to a smaller apartment
POST: Well I'm at a loss. I've had cats all my life and they've always been perfect and not obnoxious in the slightest. Unfortunately that's not really the case anymore, and I don't know what to do about it.

I got a kitten when I was in college, about 6 years ago (making her about 6 years old). She's been spayed etc, and has always behaved in an apartment setting. She's moved three times with me to progressively bigger apartments (600 sqft to 800 to 1100, every time with roommates) and has been great! However, 5 months ago I moved in with my girlfriend to an 800 sqft apartment, and the poor kitty is completely inconsolable. The only time she doesn't cry (and loudly) is when she's tired. We play with her, we cuddle with her, let her get fresh air on the balcony, and she's never acted aggressively towards anyone,  but she just cries and cries and cries. I think it might be stress from the smaller apartment and the large chunks of day when no one is at home, but I don't know. Any ideas on how to fix this behavior? I'm worried about neighbors complaining.
TL;DR:
