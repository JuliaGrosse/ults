TITLE: I'm trying to rehome a wonderful cat with special needs.  Any advice?
POST: Here's the deal:
Three months ago, I took in a cat that was scheduled to be euthanized at a local shelter.  She was older (about 12), and super emaciated, but I totally fell for her personality and wanted to give her a second chance.  

She is an awesome cat.  She's super friendly and people-oriented, basically follows me from room to room, loves to sit on my lap, and sleeps with me every night.  Great cat for someone who wants a constant companion.

BUT

She turned out to have some sort of intestinal disorder (probably either irritable bowel syndrome or intestinal lymphoma, but we can't tell without biopsies).  It caused chronic diarrhea, and was probably part of the reason she was so emaciated.  For some reason, she also can't eat dry food - she vomits every time, but doesn't have problems with wet food.

Now, all four of my roommates insist that I can't keep her (we're moving into a no pets apartment, and the roommates really don't like her).  I need to find her a new home ASAP.
She's doing much better, her diarrhea is under control with steroids/antibiotics, and she's gaining weight.  She is still very skinny, though.  

I can't take her back to the shelter.  I also have doubts about adoption agencies (even ones that take senior/sick cats), because they all seem to be filled with kittens right now.

Anyone have any advice?  Optimistically, does anyone know someone in the SF bay area interested in a special needs cat?

I really don't want euthanasia to be an option, she's so nice, and her quality of life is good.
TL;DR:
