TITLE: Fuck me. (20/m) (19/f) (19/f)
POST: So long story short, my girlfriend of 2+ years cheated on me about a month back. Things have been rocky since then and things just weren't the same. I tried to make things work because I love her and care about her and does the same. But I thought it would be best to move on. 
Before my girlfriend of 2+ years and I got together, I had a best friend who I had a thing for since the first day I met her. She gets me. We stopped talking for about a year because of some issues we had with each other but I really, really missed her. We started talking again about 2 months ago and she makes me so happy. We've hung out a few times and all these feelings I once had for her came flooding back. She just got out of a horrible relationship with an abusive guy a few weeks ago, and she's not ready for a relationship. I told her about my feelings for her and I told her that if she doesn't want that I'm totally okay with it because I'm just happy to have her back in my life. She just wants to be best friends and see if it leads to anything more, but we're being flirty and stuff with each other.
Here's the big problem, my ex girlfriend is still a big part of my life. I want to move on and not be with her, but I care about her. She bought me knicks tickets for my birthday and wants to give them to me still, but I don't know whether to take them or not. I wanted to take the girl I'm talking to, to a knicks game, but now idk what to do because my ex got me tickets and If I take them and take this other girl it's going to be rude and disrespectful. I want to be with this new girl and see if things work out, but I feel like there are still feelings for my ex and everything's just going crazy right now. This was probably so incoherent and whatever but it's because I've got so much going through my mind right now. What do I do.
TL;DR:
