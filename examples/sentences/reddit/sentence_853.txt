TITLE: Me [23 M] with my Ex [22 F] of 5 months. How do I build back her trust to be in a relationship with me again?
POST: This is a throwaway.

Background: My ex and I had been dating for 5 months. About a couple of weeks ago, she moved to a college town about 5 hours away. I offered to go with her while transferring my job. Within those 5 months, she broke up with me twice( I had went to a dinner with my ex without informing her very early in the relationship and she saw the photo on FaceBook and she broke up again later due to her not wanting me to uproot my life for her.)

On the 5th, I went up to go see her for the weekend and to do a job interview in her area. At her request, she asked if I can stay the week and I said yes.On the 12th, we get into an argument about a text I had sent to a girl and why I deleted it. At the time I told her it was a friend who had an abortion. The Sunday before I left, we argue about it again. She doesn't believe me when I said it was my friends fling and says that I had cheated on her and got some girl pregnant or had intentions to cheat with the girl that I was texting. We then break up over this. I've tried to tell her that I haven't cheated or done anything in the wrong.
TL;DR:
