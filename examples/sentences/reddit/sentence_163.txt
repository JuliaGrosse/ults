TITLE: I [23] am worried she [22] will forget my birthday.
POST: Me: 23 M

Her: 22 F

Together for about 6 months.

My birthday is in roughly a week. She hasn't mentioned it. Should I be worried that she could forget it? She knows when it is, or at least, we have talked about it in the past and so I can expect that she knows. But she hasn't mentioned anything about it in the past 2 months. Should I remind her? Or should I just wait and see if she remembers? If she forgets, what should I do?

Sorry if this seems pedantic- it probably is. But my last GF, while not forgetting about my Bday, always had lack-luster responses about it. Not getting bday sex was the least of my worries with her. We were together for a good while, so I don't know if I should be worried about this or not or what to do.
TL;DR:
