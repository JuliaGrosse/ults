TITLE: Me [24M] with my Girlfriend [23F] almost three years, she wants to move in with me while I am in law school
POST: So I will be going to Law School in the next year, and for most of undergrad I was able to live at home to save money. My girlfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. Lately she has been really pushing for us to move in together when I go to law school.

I am not opposed to the whole thing, but there are certain circumstances that pertain to my situation. She works full time and goes to school full time. In law school I will barely be able to work, and the bar association has strict rules for law students as far as how much they can work, so she will be the one providing the majority of the finances. My parents also told me that they would help me out. She told me that she would support me to accomplish my dream of going to law school.

As with any school financial situation, student loans do not have to be paid on while in school, so that is not an immediate financial issue. Basically, I find it flattering that someone is willing to support me to accomplish my dream, but I do not want to place that burden on someone else. I do realize my parents have been helping me out, and my girlfriend and I have been together for almost three years, but the whole situation would be an immense amount of trust.
TL;DR:
