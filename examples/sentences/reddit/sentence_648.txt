TITLE: Me [20 M/F] with my ex/girl I love [20 F] of about 2 years are struggling in college. What should I do?
POST: Too make the breakup story incredibly short, she dumped me to "explore" her feelings in college (later learned she has been crushing on some other guy). Treated her like a princess. We grew so much together, and she told me if we lived 40 years ago she would have married me when we were 18. 

Fast forward several long months after our breakup. She has a tendency to seem quite bipolar. One day she calls me and tells me she loves me and misses me like crazy and wants all the familiarity of me, and then two days later she will get very fussy with me and demand I give her more space. I'm very confused to say the least. 

The thing is, I know in my head what I SHOULD do, but damn I seriously fell head over heals in love with this girl while we were together. On top of that, her family and even extended family tell me how much they miss me, how great I was for her. Her little cousins even told me they wanted to be just like me when they grow up. 

She constantly tells me that she is confused, and that she still has conflicted feelings for me. I love her with all of my heart, but damn she can really mess with my head. 

Honestly, I'm just looking for opinions. My heart is telling me to be patient, that she will figure things out, but my mind and some of my friends are telling me to move on.
TL;DR:
