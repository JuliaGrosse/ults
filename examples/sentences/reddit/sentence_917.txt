TITLE: I'm repulsed with my country's tradition. Why does my country punish those who seek higher education?
POST: Pissed off guy in Indonesia here. The campus "orientation" period in here is still ridiculous, and I've heard similar 'tradition' that's still happening in countries like India.

In western movies/films, campus orientation period is just that, an orientation period. Freshmen are told how uni works, how to manage time, school activites, etc.

It's just outright organized bullying. I don't know what started this, why seniors would one day just think "Hey, these guys are born 2 years later than us! Let's treat them lower than cockroaches" and professors+uni boards went "Sure, why the fuck not."

I can give you some perspective since I can dig up some stuff in my language:

There's this campus which creates a mandatory "field trip" for all freshmen. In this particular campus, these atrocities have happened :

- Freshmen forced to strip and "make love" to each other.

- Freshmen were thrown garlic water as in to burn their eyes. 

- Freshmen were forced to drink seawater.

- Freshmen were given up to 2 water bottle to drink to share with their entire class-year. 

Note that all the "disciplinary committees" who oversee all of the campus orientation period act like prison guards, who pick 1 freshmen who stands out to torture. In this particular case, an overweight freshman got more extra attention by all the seniors. The student, Fikri, died of dehydration during that "field trip."

[Source] there are just a myriad of bizarre things that happens during "campus orientation" here. But I think what I state above gives you a general impression of what I'm talking about.  

Just what is the psychology behind this behavior? Seniors can join a student committee which are just usual student committee stuff. But some seniors can join "disciplinary committee" and suddenly it's all okay to break bad on a psychotic power trip against freshmen?
TL;DR:
