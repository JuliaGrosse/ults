SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My boyfriend [18/M] and I [17/F] have realised we are both controlling and want to sort it out to save the relationship.
POST: So to begin with, we have been in a relationship for almost a year. Before this, we were close friends through highschool for about four years and have always had a thing for eachother. We began our relationship last year when he left school, and I'm still finishing. 

So, at the start of our relationship, we knew and established we are both very jealous people. In previous relationships, we felt really jealous of our respective partners, and often came to comfort of eachother to vent. We are both aware, too, of our past's, which arn't really full of clean track records (we've both been unfaithful to some extent in previous relationships, however, not that serious and we were both like 14). 

This isnt to say that this effects us now, we have both moved past that - but, it has left us both quite controlling. And at the start, it worked. If I was uncomfortable with something, he wouldn't do it. If he was uncomfortable with something, I wouldn't do it. But it's gotten to the point now where we feel like we are missing out on things. And we both WANT to change, I cannot stress that enough. This isn't a post asking for reasons to end it, I just really need advice for both of us to sort out our feelings and what steps we can take to learn from this and move on.
TL;DR:
