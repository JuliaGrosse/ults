SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [23 M] with my [25F] GF. Don't think I did anything wrong but I still feel guilty.
POST: I'm currently in a 2.5 year long relationship with the love of my life and I couldn't be happier. I went out for drinks with my brother last night and the night basically consisted of me drinking and watching him hit on women with no success which I found hilarious. Throughout the night we had this super nice waitress hooking us up with free food which was awesome. At last call, as we stumbled out of the bar, my brother said we had forgot to tip her so he gave me a 20 and I ran back inside, gave her the tip, and said "You're super cute, have a great night!" and ran back outside to get a cab. That's it. No flirting happened over the course of the night, no touching, no numbers were recieved but I still feel really guilty, I guess for saying that she was cute! I feel like a big idiot for blowing this up in my head.
TL;DR:
