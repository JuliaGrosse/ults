TITLE: [27/m] Just broke up, losing friends, and feeling rock bottom like never before.
POST: Some background - I have a pretty large group of friends/mutual friends. One of these friends had broken up with his girlfriend two years ago and I ended up starting dating his girlfriend. They were also friends in the same group of mutual friends. The relationship lasted about a year and ended recently when it just wasn't working out. 

Right now I feel like I'm in a hole that I can't crawl out of. Since dating the ex, I feel like I've drifted apart from my friends and also the old boyfriend has become closer to the mutual friends and doesn't have many nice things to say about me. Now that my girlfriend and I have split up, I feel like I've lost everything.

Everyday, I see through social websites i.e. facebook all the things that everybody is doing and that I'm not really invited to. What makes it worse is that my ex is invited to hangout with them. Feeling this everyday is the worst feeling in the world.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I fucked up dating within my group of friends and also and friend's ex gf. I feel as though everybody has a negative impression of me at this point and there's no way out for me. Its quite a large group of friends and I'm really starting to feel like its a small world.

I can't stop thinking about how shitty this feels and the feeling of being excluded. I have a full time job and I work out regularly but thats not enough. I have no idea what to do at this point. I really am starting to feel like my life is over and theres no way to come back. I feel like im stuck. Is there anything I can do?
TL;DR:
