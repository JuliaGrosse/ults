TITLE: How to deal with parents who treat you like you're 14 when your 18 years old.
POST: My girlfriend is home for the holidays and her parents are still trying to control her life. I understand that since they are still paying for things in her life (college, life insurance, ext) that they still get a say. But it's getting to the point that even though it has been only two weeks, she's considering cutting all ties. It's a strong possibility for her to stay with me for the remainder of the break (my dad had a similar situation when he was our age) but by doing so her very strong catholic parents would cease all contact with her. This upcoming summer she is planning on getting her own place anyways, but the situation is getting worse at her place. My question (yes, I know...it took long enough) is what is the best course of action. Should she deal with her parents until the summer, or should she cut off all ties and live on her own. I'm also curious if any others have had similar situations and if so what did you do.
TL;DR:
