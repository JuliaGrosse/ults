TITLE: Anyone want to discuss Gone With The Wind with me?
POST: My girlfriend and I suggested books for each other. I chose "Dune" for her, obviously. And she chose "Gone with the Wind" for me. I have waited a while to post this to see if my feelings changed, which they haven't, so I'm looking for someone to agree or tell me I am stupid.

After finishing this book, I honestly think it is the "great American novel". As a reader, I try to consume as many of the classics as I do modern books. I had low expectations for this 1000+ pages because of all the hype about the movie(which ive never seen). But I was pleasantly surprised. I was amazed at how well Margaret Mitchell was able to develop her characters and make you feel so many emotions about them. I think it was brave of her to make the protagonist such a selfish, spiteful, entitled asshole most of the time. While making her such a determined, independent badass the rest. I think Rhett is a wonderful counterpoint. And the fact that she filled every inch of that book with gripping story impressed me.

I know its not perfect. There were some clich√©s that bugged me a bit. It was definitely written in a style without flair and surely intended to be accessible to all readers. The ending wounded me a bit. And some characters I wanted more or less of. But as a whole, I think it is a brilliant piece of writing. I will definitely recommend it to others.
TL;DR:
