POST: Alright, no one really knows this because I'm so ashamed to tell the story of it; but here goes.  

  When I was 14, I had a 16 year old girl come over to hang out with me.  We were actually really good friends and I didn't intend on anything to happen.  Going on, we were in my basement talking about random stuff that's been going on, but then we decided to go into my room to watch a movie (I have a flat screen at the end of my bed).  

At this time, my 14 year old tendencies are kicking up and my hormones are starting to cause me to think with my other head.  We get into watching the movie and we're laying down on our stomachs facing the screen.  We start getting into the movie and she starts complaining how she's cold, so I put my arm around her and got close.  The proceeds to me rubbing her back, hand in shirt, hand in pants etc. etc.  I'm having a grand old time because this was the first time I'd done anything like this.

So it progresses and I move my hand in her shirt and around to the opposite side and grab her boob.  She glances over at me and makes a little smirk and kisses me on the lips.  NOW, be aware that I had never kissed a girl until this point.  I was stunned.  I just looked back at her with a stunned face; she leans in and takes a couple more smooches like she wanted to start making out... I didn't move, or kiss back.  I just sat there not knowing what to do.  

She kind of got the idea after the second time that I had no idea what I'm doing and she stopped trying.  However, I still tried.  She wasn't too fond of me feeling her up after I straight-faced her.  She pulled my hand out, switched positions and laid down on her back under the covers, and I just sat there.  We finished watching the movie, her parents came and picked her up and she went home.

I haven't talked to her since.

*So close..
