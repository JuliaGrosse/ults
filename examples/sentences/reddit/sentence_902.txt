SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My boyfriend [19M] doesn't make time for me now that we've moved in together. I've moved 300 miles across the country, so I'm very isolated.
POST: The title rather explains it, but here goes:-

We've been together roughly a year now and it's been great. We've always sat down and talk about things that troubled us, because we're not mind readers. 

I've tried to talk to him about this but I didnt really achieve much, he acknowledged what I said, but nothing's changed.

The fact is, I've moved 300 miles away from friends and family, I have no job yet and no money. So I'm largely dependant on him at the moment, which is killing me as he's working, playing on the computer or spending time with his friends.

I just feel a little hurt because he spent much more time with me when we weren't living together. Now that we do, our relationship has been dumbed down to "Hey, how are you" and a reply when passing. 

I have depression, which means that the isolation can be very damaging.   I dont have medication for it, I just try to keep myself active, eating well and exercising and surrounding myself with people.

But, since I'm 300 miles away I've lost all this and I'm worried that I'll slump again. 

We were supposed to go out for dinner last night, but instead he played a game on steam with a friend. He was also supposed to help me unpack and move in, but instead I've had to do all that. 

Don't get me wrong though, he's a nice guy, buys me my favourite food when he knows I'm upset and all that jazz, but it's exhausting wondering where he is and if we're actually going to spend any time together before going to bed.
TL;DR:
