SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [23F] think I am beginning to fall for my ex boyfriend's best friend [24M]. Not sure how to tell if he feels the same or if I should pursue it.
POST: I dated his bestfriend for about a month. Some time has passed since then (but not too much), and my ex now lives thousands of miles away. His bestfriend sent me a text a week and a half ago asking how I am doing and that he's been trying to figure out how to get a hold of me because he misses hanging out. 

So, we caught up via text and we have been texting everyday since then. I even invited him to hang out with my friends and me and he said he had a lot of fun and thanked me. He and I have both been depressed lately and in bad places, but talking to one another has helped us both out so much. He calls it a symbiotic relationship, which seems true. We both play music and are starting to create a music project together. Last night, while I was at work, he made a dinner he "invented" and wanted me to have some. My work is fairly far from where he lives but he insisted on bringing it to me. We hung out when I got off my shift and talked for hours about nothing and everything until the sunrise. It seemed like minutes. 

 I know it's too soon to tell if he has any feelings for me, but even though it's only been a little over a week, I am starting to really like him. I don't know if he feels the same because he always goes for super model looking girls, and I dated his bestfriend which is a huge no-no for some guys. 

So basically, I just want to know if you think I should wait and maybe give it a shot or shoukd I let it go? Do you think he is starting to like me? 

Note: He is moving at the end of the year, very far away.
