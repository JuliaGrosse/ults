TITLE: Me [25 M] asked [22 F] on a second date, she cancelled. Where to from here?
POST: So after a good first date I asked her out again a week later, just over to mine, watch a film, pretty relaxed and casual compared to the first date, she said yes and sounded enthusiastic.  

I text her that day to see if she was still on for watching a film later at my place. She said yes and would give me a txt before she called over.  

A couple of hours pass and then I get a little paragraph of a txt to the effect of - She'd been in a terrible mood all day. She felt she wouldn't be good company for the night, that it was for my own good and that she'll have to rain check. I simply replied 'No problem' and left it at that.  

I feel her reason for cancelling is pretty valid and I haven't questioned it. But my question is, where do I go from here?  Do I contact her and try rearrange or do I just leave it and wait for her to make contact with me?
TL;DR:
