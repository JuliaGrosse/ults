TITLE: Should I [24M] bother dating or am I not ready?
POST: I'm 24, live with my parents and only make about 28k a year. 

I guess I should list positives. I own my car, bought it with cash, have a good amount of money saved up. I started lifting late last year, my numbers are not where I want them to be but I'm still lifting 2-3 times a week. 

I'm just worried that I don't make enough money to hold a relationship or have a woman be ok with the amount that I make. I'm not incredibly good looking, pretty short at 5'8, and I only really have 4 or 5 real friends, none of which are women. 

Where would I go to meet women? I'm totally open to just meeting women and knowing them to expand my social circle but I do not know where to go to speak with women without seeming creepy/stalkerish. 

I honestly don't know if I'm too ugly, too poor or just not interesting enough for a relationship. Not even sure if I've missed the boat and may be too old to start dating.

 I'd like to believe I'm single because I haven't really ever tried going on dates or approach women out in the open but I feel like I don't qualify to try and date because of my living situation/income.
TL;DR:
