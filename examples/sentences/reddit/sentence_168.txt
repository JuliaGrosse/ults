TITLE: Am [23/m] I asking too much from my girlfriend [22/f]? Advice appreciated. [xpost /r/relationships]
POST: Our relationship has been going for a little over 9 months. Before we started dating I was in the military and now I'm a civilian going to college. Before I started school in January I had a full-time job. Now that I'm in school I'm working about 3 days per week. The amount of hours I get workd fine for me, it gives me time to work on school work and I'm not hurting for money because I have savings and I receive a housing allowance because of my military service using the GI Bill.

She has no problem with how much I work. But its her family that has a huge problem with it. They feel I should work full time and go to school full time. But Im not doing that. There's no reason to.
Because I don't work enough in their eyes I'm a terrible person and they even go as far as blaming me for the problems their daughter is having. She forgot to do something? My faults. She doesn't know what she wants to do after she finishes college? My fault. Etc. Then they have the nerve to criticize every single thing I do or say. I get no respect from them.

I told her unless she tells them that I want to feel respected and welcomed into their home, I will not be going to her house. She thinks its my responsibility to talk to them about it. Even though if she was in my situation she would expect me to talk to my parents about the problem.

Who should it be that talks to her parents? Am I wrong for taking a stand and not going there if I feel that I'm disrespected? Am I being reasonable in being upset about how they treat me? Much advice is appreciated. Thank you.
TL;DR:
