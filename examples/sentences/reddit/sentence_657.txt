TITLE: Me [25 F] and my SO [26 M] are celebrating our year anniversary, and neither of us can think of anything to do. Help!
POST: Not sure if this is the place to be posting this, but I'm really desperate. Our original plan was to go on a five day cruise, but he switched jobs and there are some issues with getting the time off. We were thinking about doing a 3 day cruise instead, but I'm not sure that I want to pack a cruise into three days. Does anyone have any ideas that might be able to be packed into three days and not cost an arm and a leg? We've had a crazy year and I want something special to seal this one and look forward to the next. Also, my elderly father lives with us, so bonus points if it gets us away from that situation for a night or so.
TL;DR:
