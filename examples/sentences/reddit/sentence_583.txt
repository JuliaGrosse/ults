TITLE: Me [17F] with my ex boyfriend [18M] of 1.5 years, broke up and feel empty inside
POST: My boyfriend and I broke up about two week ago. We dated for almost a year and a half, shy by about a month. Now, I'm missing him so much. Today I've been feeling pretty sad. To quote Hawaii 5o, "I went from being the busiest woman in the world to having nothing but time on my hands." And, well, that sucks. I'm cycling through friends, trying not to bug them all because I feel so guilty about texting them all the time and always missing my boyfriend. 

I loved him a lot but we fought a lot and it wasn't healthy. But I still miss him. We use to text constantly. Now I just want a hug. But I know I can't ask him for one. I don't know who to turn to. I keep relying on people and friends, and I know I need to rely on myself, but how?
TL;DR:
