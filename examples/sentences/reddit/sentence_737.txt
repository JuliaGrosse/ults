TITLE: I want to get a tattoo but I want to do it right. What should I know? Where should I go? Any other tips?
POST: I don't know any more about tattoos than the average person, and although I know of a couple places in my area (Twin Cities, MN) I wanted to ask you guys a few things.

What should I know? By this I mean just general things people should know when wanting to get a tattoo. Price range? (I know it depends.) Good/bad colors? (I'm white, about average skin tone.) Cliche tattoos? (Common ones most don't know about... or something.) What are the best/worse or most/least painful places to get them? I'm not sure what else, just tattoo stuff I should know.

Where should I go? What are some methods of knowing if a place is good or not? What are some red flags I should look for? If you know the Twin Cities, what would you recommend?

For other tips, I'm looking for pretty much anything. Should I bring a friend or go solo? (I'm a guy). Should I shower beforehand? Any short-term or long-term care tips that I should know of? What are some relatively unknown hacks?

Another thing I'm curious of is how to go about a design. Basically, I want something with the [German] and [Irish] coat of arms intertwined somehow (something classy but modern) and the letter J above or below the German coat of arms and the letter M above or below the Irish coat of arms in some sort of script. Are there any websites or places I could mess with ideas?

I'm also leaning towards my left shoulder blade for location, so big enough to fill that area but not be gigantic.
TL;DR:
