TITLE: I [23M] have trouble communicating with my [23F] SO
POST: We've been together almost 5 years, and both close to graduating undergrad (both plan on pursuing higher ed). 

We've had more highs than I can count, but a good amount of lows too. Most of those are due to the fact that a lot of time when we have serious discussions (like issues with the relationship or sometimes if she is just trying to correct me on something) I usually freeze up, stonewall, or I get extremely nervous and stop being productive in the conversation. She can always tell when I'm getting upset and when she'll ask me if she said something that upset me or if something else was bothering me. I'll always say no, or I'm just anxious but not that bad, and then when we talk about it later she was right. I bury my feelings a lot and am scared of confrontation with almost anyone. 

I'm also really bad at introspection to begin with, like really bad. I think in my upbringing my family never *dealt* with issues and I didn't see my parents too much. I spent most of my free time with the same equally awful friends. Growing up I didn't learn how to sit with my emotions and have productive conversations with people. I'd just remove myself and sit in silence until they were finished talking so everything would go back to normal. 

We've had this issues more times than I can count and I desperately want to stop this immature behavior. I know it's wrong, yet every time I start to get anxious I end up repeating the same behavior. It usually takes us all night, if not a day or two, to finish talking about issues. Even so, that behavior usually reverts back after a few days.  

I know I'm in the wrong here. I finally believe I'm starting to get a grip on myself, and I know I probably need therapy, but I just want to be able to communicate with my partner. I'm trying to find a way to show my SO because we've tried talking this matter to death.
TL;DR:
