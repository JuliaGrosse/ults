TITLE: How to Cope up with breakup
POST: My boyfriend [25] and I [20] have.. Had I guess been dating for almost two years now. It was a very on and off thing. We broke up almost a month and a half ago and we got back together after 2 weeks. 
This time things were different. He bought up his concerns and when we got together I made sure that his concerns weren't there anymore and I tried really hard to be an amazing girlfriend.

I put in a lot of effort and today he got upset because I wasn't able to hang out when he was free. And he straight up said that he wasn't happy and I wasn't trying which hurt so much for so many reasons. He said we should be in an open relationship and I said I'm not going to go down that road and broke up with him. 

I know it's the right thing to do but idk how do deal with being single, having no one to send messages to and not having to talk to him. How do I keep myself distracted and not talk to him. I have no will power and that's why I keep going back to him. This is the only relationship ive been in. Also, my birthday is in 10 days so I would like to deal with this shit as soon as possible
TL;DR:
