SUBREDDIT: r/Advice
TITLE: Freaking out about everything relating to school; Really need advice
POST: I am currently a 19-year old pre-med student at a public university. It is currently my 2nd year here, but I'm at a junior standing. While I came in with a pretty good head on my shoulders, I feel like I'm just taking a turn for the worst.

This semester, I'm currently taking classes such as Organic Chemistry 1 + Lab and Bio 2 + Lab. For my first few exams, I did pretty well. 93s on both my first organic chemistry exam and my first biology exam.. But then my exam grades got worse and worse.

I'm currently sitting here freaking out about my organic chemistry final exam because there is too much information to memorize and regurgitate onto the exam..

I'm currently debating on taking a semester or year off college because it doesn't feel right to me. However, I don't have any other passions than to become a pediatrician. But I know that I don't even compare to any other pre-med student here with a 3.3 GPA and not getting A's in every science class I've taken. I haven't done any volunteer work or shadowing, and I'm not sure where I could even do this.

All I want to do is sit in my dorm room and play video games. I feel like I'm throwing my life away, but I know that I'm more interested in pro-gaming than I am with my education. What do I do?? I'm freaking out.. And thank you for taking the time to read this for anyone who stood by.
TL;DR:
