SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: My girlfriend had an old boyfriend stay in her room the past two nights. She seems to think that's ok.
POST: They are using the same bed, and did last night as well. 

(I am 21, she is 18 with the mind of a 30 year old)

we were OK tonight, but it had been bothering me the whole day, so with my friends advice I told her exactly how I felt about the situation (Thretened, amazed that she would think this was ok, ect.). She responded with venom, and turned every point that I made into something against me (that I am being selfish, who gives you the right to blah blah blah).

The only reason I was OK with this (she asked me) was that I really thought she would find him another bed to sleep in.
I am so incredibly stupidly in love with this girl it's not even funny. I dont care if it ends, I just want it to end well so we can still talk.

(back story)

I am a romantic who opens themselves up to a person complealy when it comes to a committed relationship.

we have been dating for seven months

For the last month or so, she has been distant and wanting more space

This week we had a fight about "space", and I have been laying off as much as possible, letting her engage me. I stayed over Friday night, and we had a great Sunday morning, untill she rolls over at tells me that he is coming up up in a few hours. from that point on, she was very cold and distant.
TL;DR:
