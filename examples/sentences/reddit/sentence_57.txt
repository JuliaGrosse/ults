TITLE: I'm At My Wits End
POST: Here's the situation. I live in a house that my husband and I are buying. My best friend lives with us and pays rent. He has lived with me for many years, even before my husband and I were together. We generally all get along. The problem is my best friend's cat. I've found a new home for my cat because his cat was terrrorizing it. My best friend has told me straight up that he will move out if I ask him to get rid of the cat. But the cat has destroyed my couches (not declawed) among many other pieces of furniture, and shits and vomits in our floor every day. He goes in the litter box AND he shits in the front dining room, the office, the kitchen, whereever he pleases. The problem is, with the economy the way it is, we cannot afford to live in our house if my best friend moves out. So its like we are being held hostage by this cats behavior. My best friend refuses to do anything about it. Every day he has a new excuse. He calls the shitting "accidents" when it is clearly just a behavior problem that we've accepted for over 3 years now and will not go away. I've bought the spray that you spray where you don't want the cat to go, it doesn't work. We've tried to lock the cat in my best friends bedroom, he gets out. Not to mention the fact that my best friends' girlfriend's puppy is now living with us and has pissed and shit so much on our futon in the guest room that it is ruined. But that's another subject. What do I do? I am so close to just moving into an apartment and waiting for the house to be foreclosed on - but my husband doesn't want to do that.
TL;DR:
