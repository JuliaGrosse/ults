TITLE: We've found ourselves staying across from refugee building in Istanbul
POST: We temporarily have a 3rd floor apartment in Istanbul which is across the street from  what is something like a refugee 'prison' in Kumkapi.  The'residents' dont seem maltreated, but they are definitely locked in.  While smoking a cigarette out of our window, they started a conversation with us.  It was a very humbling experience.  We weren't able to gather very much, as the security guard(the one with the rifle and the bulletproff vest) pretty clearly told us to stop after a few minutes of yelling back & forth across the street.  The majority of them are refugees from Syria(at least 1 person from Pakistan), and include women & children, and they will be transfered to a refugee camp in 3 days.  Somebody from some window said "s.o.s."  The entire encounter lasted only 3 minutes, but may be one of the most moving experiences in all of my travels.  Given all of the current tensions between the US(our country) and the middle east, we feel obliged to continue to communicate with them, although as they are behind both bars and a hatched grate, it'll probably only be one directional.  We want to express our solidarity to them, and let them know that americans in general are very friendly people, depites all of our political/social problems, problems that a lot of middle easterners seem to clearly extrapolate to the entire county.  Our current plans are to procure some posterboard or something similar with the word [Asabiyyah] ( and put it in our window, and also to see if the guards will let us give their children some soccer balls, as they seem to have a small playground.  Are there any arabic speakers here?  What can we best do to get this point across?
TL;DR:
