SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: Me [late 20's M] with my [late 20's F] wife of 6 years. Had relationship issues a year ago and can't stop thinking about divorce.
POST: Summary from last year

I was thinking about our relationship and where we were at. I ask her how she thinks things are. We end up deciding to divorce, but she took a look at herself and things she needed to work on. I decided to stay and work things out with her. 

Lately, I cannot stop thinking about all the events that happened last year. I have been looking at divorce more and more. I cannot get these thoughts out of my mind. We don't really have any relationship problems, but I do not think we are compatible romantically. We don't have many shared interests and don't have conversations unless it is about work or some family gossip, etc...

Please give me some advice. Do I start the divorce process or do I stay in the relationship that I don't feel will last much longer.
TL;DR:
