TITLE: My [16M] school staff [20sF] has been staring and smiling at me whenever I sometimes go to the canteen and I am getting crept out.
POST: I can't believe I have to ask for advice.....

Regarding my school, it is a very small school compared to my big one. 5 to 10 students with only 4 classrooms. I began my school year on July 2016 (Last month) and I'm now on my (hopefully) final year.

Regarding the school staff, there has been this one new female staff in her early 20s who works in the Canteen/Activity Room alone and always has the maids/yayas (Filipino term for maids).

So, over the past days and weeks, whenever I go to the room for a drink, to eat, or to interact with friends, she will always stare and smile at me for absolutely no fucking reason. Even if I'm being very quiet or something, she would sometimes do that for no fucking reason, and I've been getting crept out up to this day and just recently, she wants to add me as a friend on Facebook.

I don't want to tell my teachers, my friends, and my family about this since I don't want to get in huge trouble, but I feel worried about myself at the same time.

I've always questioned myself regarding her since my possible theories are:

1 - I'm just being very paranoid and misunderstood

2 - She might literally have a romantic interest in me

3 - She just likes to smile, but at me for no reason

or 4 - She could be part of a gang with me as her 'next' target

Is there any help that can help me possibly overcome it?
