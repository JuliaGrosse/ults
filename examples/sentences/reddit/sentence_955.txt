SUBREDDIT: r/relationships
TITLE: I [21M] almost had sex with a friend [21F], we're closer for it, but I want a relationship with her.
POST: My friend [21F] and I [21M] have been friends since we started university together on the same course 3 years ago. Up until a month or so ago, there had been no sexual feelings between either of us, that is until alcohol was involved. 

We hadn't seen each other for a few months as we were both abroad and when we got back we decided that we needed a catch up. I met up with her, we chatted and had a few drinks until eventually it was pretty late and she offered to let me stay over. However, it turned out that she had no spare bedding for the couch and said that we could sleep in her bed. This quickly led to us cuddling which led to spooning, etc.. I won't go into to much detail, but we didn't actually have sex as neither of us had a condom. We did seem to be very sexually compatible though.

The next days and weeks have been great, no awkwardness, and we've become much closer for it. Because of this, I realised that we're good friends and seem to be sexually compatible, so my mind starts ticking over, and I realise that I'm falling for her. We've talked about what happened (while she was very, very drunk) and she felt the same way and we decided to see what happens between us. 

There are, unfortunately, some problems. She is incredibly busy with her sporting endevours so we only really get to see each other at uni. I do keep asking her to go out or to meet up just the two of us, but she's either busy doing uni work, training, or recovering from training for me to actually see her. So the problem is, I'm left in this limbo where she is more than a friend at this point, but not my girlfriend. We're never alone, but it's not like we never see each other. I don't know what to do, I'm pretty knew to the whole dating game so I wondered what I could do to make things work out?
TL;DR:
