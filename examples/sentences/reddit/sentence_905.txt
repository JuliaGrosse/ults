SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit
TITLE: My brother kept using my toothbrush instead of his. So I told him that I got diagnosed with a mouth disease that he exposed himself to thanks to him using my toothbrush. Reddit, what creative solutions have you come up with to deal with irritating siblings?
POST: So, my brother and I, like most siblings, share a bathroom. My sink is the closer one to the door, and I tend to keep my stuff out by the side instead of just stowing it in a cabinet. Problem is, my brother had gotten so lazy that he would not walk the few extra steps to use his own sink and toothbrush. Since I get ready and leave much later than he does (late college classes FTW), I find the most wonderful surprise of my wet, used toothbrush while his is bone dry. This may be a pet peeve of mine, buts it's gross and can spread disease. Parents won't do anything, so after I come back from an early doctor's appointment and find my toothbrush used again. I call my brother.

Me: "Have you been using my toothbrush again?"
Brother: "No." (Pathological liar. Fools everyone)
Me: "I just got back from the doctor, and I need to know if you did."
Brother: No, you're so gay!
Me: I may have a mouth disease called (I made up some latin sounding terminology), which can cause bleed sores on the inside of the mouth. Since you use my toothbrush, you may have gotten exposed to it!"

Suffice to say, my brother flipped out. I then told him it was all a story, and warned him not to use my toothbrush again. He hasn't since.
TL;DR:
