TITLE: I (F16) have shared feelings with my best friend (M16) but really don't want to mess up our friendship...
POST: I'm sure you guys have seen this a lot and I know how cheesy the 'best friend who has been there all along' thing is, but I'm not really sure what to do and I REALLY don't want to mess up my relationship with this guy.

So, my best male friend for years now (I think like 8 years) and I have always had a bit of a mixed relationship. He has wanted more with me on and off but I have always been hesitant. I really value our friendship and don't want to mess it up if/when we break it off, and also I have never had a real relationship and I don't want my first to go badly, especially with someone I already care about so much. I do want more with him, I'm just not sure how much more or in what level of commitment.

He has told one of our close mutual friends that he really does want something more with me but that he doesn't want to make a move unless he is sure I feel the same way.

Just to make it all more complicated, we have all of the same friends and if we broke up it would cause a really big social issue among our group.

Any stories of similar problems or advice would be awesome.
TL;DR:
