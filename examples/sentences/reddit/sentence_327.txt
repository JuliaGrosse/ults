TITLE: Highschool Senior male (me) dating Freshman Girl?
POST: So there is this freshman girl who moved into the house right across the road from me just over a year ago. I've actually had my eye on for a little bit, and actually had the courage to walk up to her in the morning on Tuesday whilst walking to the bus stop. We seemed to have hit it off, though I've only talked to her to and from the bus since Tuesday and Today (Wednesday), but so far everything is well. We've only had small talk, such as how we're doing in school, how she likes the neighborhood, and other general school stuff. I actually switched my seat from mine to hers on the bus ride to school which she seemed to be OK with.

**Now here's what my question is**: How will I be able to tell if this 14 year old girl is interested in me (17)? I'm willing to be that there's other guys that are probably interested in her though, but I am not sure if she has a boyfriend. I have been told by other girls that I am cute / attractive, so I think I have that going for me, but I'm not sure if she is interested in me. 
 
I have yet to get her phone number, and I don't think she has a facebook, but she seems pretty chill so far. And another plus is that she lives right across the street, so I would be able to see her whenever. I haven't had any relationships my whole High School career, so I was hoping you guys could help me with this! Thanks!
TL;DR:
