Reception

Critical reception to florasongs was mixed, but mostly positive. The EP did not receive a rating from an aggregate score website, but it did garner reviews from primarily independent music criticism websites. Pitchfork's Evan Rytlewski wrote in his review, "Unlike its full-length counterpart, though, Florasongs has brevity working in its favor." Rytlewski later penned, "Florasongs never overcomes the sense that theyâ€™re selling themselves short, penning good-enough songs when they used to shoot for grand, great ones."
