Plot 
The work is narrated by Ambrose Tree as he asks his elderly Uncle William about the story of the "Cripplegate Giant" Harry Peake, his daughter Martha, and Lord Francis Drogo, a famous anatomist that William served during his youth. Throughout the story there are gaps in the narrative as Uncle William is encouraged to reveal more and in one instance Ambrose falls into a fever, leading him to believe that something haunts Drogo Hall. As the story of Martha and Harry is told, Ambrose explores the house and becomes convinced that his uncle has been complicit in the death of Harry Peake so
