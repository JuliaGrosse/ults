In addition to the Breeders' Cup Mile, he won the More Than Ready Mile Stakes and the Fourstardave Handicap, and over $2 million in earnings.

Background
Tourist is a dark bay horse with a broad white blaze on his forehead. Bred by WinStar Farm, he was sired by Tiznow, who is one of their most influential stallions. Tiznow was a late developing horse who won back-to-back Breeders' Cup Classics, and is known for siring offspring that also tend to develop later in their career and are best at a distance of a mile and up. Tiznow is the most important modern descendant of Man o' War
