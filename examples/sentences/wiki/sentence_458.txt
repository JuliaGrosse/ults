The ruins of Wolfsberg Castle () are the remains of a former high mediaeval, aristocratic, castle which stands high above the Trubach valley over the eponymous village of Wolfsberg. The village is part of the municipality of Obertrubach in the Upper Franconian county of Forchheim in the German state of Bavaria.

The upper bailey is permanently open to the public and serves as a viewing point; the lower bailey is partly in private ownership and is not accessible.

Location 
The ruins of this spur castle lie within the Franconian Switzerland-Veldenstein Forest Nature Park on an eastwards-pointing hill spur at a height of 436 metres. The spur is separated by a natural saddle from the plateau to the west.
The spur sits between the Trubach valley to the south and a dry valley on the northern side of the spur that opens into the Trubach valley.
