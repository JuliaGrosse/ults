Women's roles in agriculture in Afghanistan have been shaped by the cultural landscape of the country. Women comprise nearly half of the farming and agricultural workforce in Afghanistan. In recent years, women have been contributing to farm work and be earning money or barter goods for their contributions.

History 
Like the Amish in the United States, Afghan men traditionally dominated farming in Afghanistan while their women were occasionally used to help work fields or tend livestock. Seed production has also traditionally been done primarily by male farmers in Afghanistan.

Women have lower land rights in Afghanistan, though the Constitution can be interpreted to allow women to own land and Islam's Sharia law has provisions for widows and daughters to inherit a share of land. Women who own or manage land in some parts of the country are unable to sell it, and the land is passed down through inheritance. Many women have also traditionally been restricted in their movements and are often unable to travel outside of their villages.
