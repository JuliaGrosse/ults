Chunaengjeon or Dance of Spring Oriole (춘앵전) is a Korean court dance (jeongjae) created during the later period of Joseon Dynasty.

History
The oldest document providing brief information about Chunaengjeon is Jinchan Uigwe (Manual of Court Banquet) published in 1848. According to Jinchan Uigwe text, Chunaengjeon have existed in Joseon court since 1649, but only then under Crown Prince Hyomyeong's tutelage it was revised and perfected. The dance was presented on the 40th birthday of Queen Sunwon in 1828. Jinchan Uigwe wrote that the Korean Chunaengjeon originated from a Chinese oriole dance which was created by Tang Gaozong's court musician.
