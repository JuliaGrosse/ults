José Manuel Ortega Heredia (Madrid, 7 February 1956 - Alhaurín de la Torre, Málaga, 5 December 2004) was a Spanish singer and guitarist.
 
In 1978, with producer José Luis de Carlos, he recorded his first solo album, Poco ruido y mucho duende, in a very personal style with flamenco nuances. The theme Verde, adapted from a poem by Lorca, was a great success. In 1980, he recorded his second LP Espíritu sin nombre with the palmero Daniel Barba de las Arenas. With his third album, in 1981, Talco y bronce, he surpassed half a million copies in Spain with the singles Un ramito de violetas and Por tu ausencia. They were followed by Cuando la noche te envuelve (1982), La quiero a morir (1983) and Mal de amores
