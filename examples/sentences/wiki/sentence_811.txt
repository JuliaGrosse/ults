MS Roald Amundsen is a new hybrid powered Hurtigruten expedition cruise ship. She was built by Kleven Yards of Norway and started her maiden voyage on 3 July 2019 from the Norwegian port Troms√∏ to Hamburg. She and her sister ship  are the first hybrid-powered ships in the Hurtigruten fleet.

Roald Amundsen was christened in fall 2019 in Antarctica with a chunk of ice instead of the traditional bottle of champagne. The vessel has Polar Class 6 rating for arctic conditions. Roald Amundsen was the first hybrid ship to sail the Northwest Passage.

Roald Amundsen was launched on 17 February 2018. In late February 2018, Hurtigruten announced that the company would not take delivery of Roald Amundsen until 2019 because of problems at the shipyard.

In 2019, the ship began expedition cruises along the Norwegian Coast, as well as trips to the North and South Poles
