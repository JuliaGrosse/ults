Gato Island is a rocky island located in the middle of Visayan Sea in the Asian country of Philippines. It rises from the sea in the general area between Malapascua Island and the more northern Carnaza Island, all of which are part of the municipality of Daanbantayan in the province of Cebu.

Etymology 
Gato Island or locally known as "Isla del Gato", which is Spanish for "Cat Island", was named so because of its shape that looks like a curled sleeping cat when looking from the mainland of Cebu.

History 
During 1933, two Japanese fishermen discovered a breeding ground of sea snakes around the island. It was believed that the locals were taught by the Japanese on how to catch the sea snakes, process the skins and even how to deal with snake bites.

The Island of Gato was previously under the administrative part of the Province of Masbate in Bicol Region of the Philippines but
